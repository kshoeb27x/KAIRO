# OpenMind

OpenMind is a local-first personal AI agent platform. The user speaks to **Felix** (the assistant's wake name), an LLM decomposes the intent into tasks, and MCP tools execute them. The central brain process is called **Cerebral**. See `CONTEXT.md` for full domain language and architecture.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Python (AI pipeline, memory, MCP execution)
- **Frontend:** Node.js + web (system tray, dark UI, animated visualiser)
- **Local LLM:** Ollama / Qwen (`qwen3:8b` on the 8GB GTX 1080; the sole kept local model)
- **Cloud LLM:** Claude (Anthropic) via OpenClaw
- **STT:** Vosk (always-on) + faster-whisper (active)
- **TTS:** Kokoro (local)
- **Memory:** RAM buffer + ChromaDB (vector) + SQLite (structured)
- **Tool protocol:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Harness:** OpenClaw (messaging + remote access gateway)

## Build rules (ADR-0028) -- these govern everything built here

Six rules, canonical text in `docs/adr/0028-reach-ladder-and-capability-rules.md`.

1. **Reach ladder -- stop at the first rung that reaches.** existing tool -> API
   plugin -> sandboxed shell -> browser session -> computer-use -> ask the human.
   Each descent costs ~10x tokens and ~10x flakiness. Never build a rung while a
   lower one already reaches. "Ask the human" is a rung, not a failure.
2. **Promote on the third repeat.** Ad hoc twice is fine; the third repeat earns a
   plugin. No speculative pre-building.
3. **Mechanism follows what is missing.** know-how -> Skill; a tool -> growth loop;
   replay of a known chain -> Recipe; Felix's own core -> `self_dev`; context room
   -> `delegate`. Not interchangeable.
4. **The ADR-0005 gate is the only permission model.** Every mechanism routes
   through the same 16-class gate, or it does not ship. No side doors.
5. **The scarce resource is the scheduler, and it is always singular.** The GPU when
   the active model is local, the one endpoint when it is remote (today: everything).
   Nothing assumes concurrency, nothing preempts; the live conversational turn wins
   contention. Model tiers: **local** (on the 1080), **remote** (over HTTP), **cloud**
   (a paid third-party API). Budd is remote, not cloud.
6. **Verified running, or it did not ship.** Green tests are necessary, not
   sufficient -- exercise the real surface (live Cerebral over the IPC bridge, the
   actual browser, the actual tray) before calling it done.
7. **Invocation ladder -- how the *user* reaches Felix, cheapest surface first.**
   speak/type -> slash command -> command palette -> sidebar route -> menu item ->
   global hotkey. Ordered by scarcity: speech is unlimited, hotkeys are ~5-8 chords
   spent permanently. Nothing earns a menu item, route, or hotkey on first ask (R2
   applies). A global hotkey is granted only when the action must fire while
   *another app* has focus -- otherwise the palette is strictly better. Plugins
   contribute panels (ADR-0012) and tools, never menu items or hotkeys.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues for this repo. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Using canonical defaults: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context repo — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Operator scripts (PowerShell)

Setup / verify / diagnostic scripts under `scripts/*.ps1` are run by the end user on Windows, often by double-clicking from Explorer. Two non-obvious gotchas (both hit during the #162 verification — see `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`):

1. **ASCII-only script bodies.** Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads `.ps1` files in the ANSI codepage when no BOM is present. UTF-8 em-dashes (`—`), smart quotes, etc. in **string literals** get mojibake'd into characters that break the parser. Comments are usually safe but keep them ASCII too for consistency. Sanity-check with `Grep "[^\x00-\x7F]"` before pushing.
2. **Pause on exit.** Double-click invocation spawns a transient `powershell.exe -File ...` console that closes the instant the script returns, hiding all output. Wrap the body in `try { ... } catch { ... } finally { Read-Host "Press Enter to close" \| Out-Null }`. The `finally` runs even when `exit` is called inside `try`. Print explicit `SUCCESS` / `FAILED` markers in colour at the end so the user sees a clear outcome.

Doesn't apply to scripts meant only for CI / chaining — those need a clean exit code with no prompt. If a script serves both audiences, use a `-NoPause` switch.

3. **Never spawn powershell.exe from Node/Electron with `detached: true`.** On this box, PowerShell 5.1 started under `DETACHED_PROCESS` exits 0 **without executing the `-File` script** — no error, no output, pid returned (bit us in #519: "Restart Felix" silently never rebooted Cerebral). Use `{ stdio: 'ignore', windowsHide: true }` instead; verified to work from both Node and Electron. The same silent-no-op reproduces from a plain PowerShell `Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList '-File',...` wrapper too (confirmed 2026-08-31 running `scripts/launch-felix.ps1` this way from a Claude Code session) — exit code 0, zero new `launcher.log` lines. Invoke a launcher script directly (`& .\scripts\launch-felix.ps1`, no `Start-Process` wrapper) instead; that reliably runs the body.

## Cerebral's real logs are at the repo root, not `.claude/tmp/`

`cerebral/main.py`'s own `logging.basicConfig` only writes to stdout — no `FileHandler` in the Python code. The actual persistence happens one layer up: `scripts/launch-felix.ps1` (the path both `restart_felix` and the tray's respawn button run) spawns Cerebral via `Start-Process -RedirectStandardOutput cerebral.log -RedirectStandardError cerebral.err.log`, both at the **repo root**. When diagnosing any live Cerebral issue, check those two files first — `Glob **/*.log` will bury them under `.claude/tmp/`'s slice-loop noise, and grepping the Python source for a `FileHandler` will (correctly, but misleadingly) turn up nothing. `launcher.log` (also repo root) covers the launch/respawn sequence itself, separate from `cerebral.err.log`'s runtime tracebacks.

Same class of trap when **searching**: `cerebral/data/sandbox/self_dev/` holds dozens of retained full-repo clones (kept deliberately), so a raw `grep -r` over `cerebral/` returns every source file N+1 times and can exceed a 2-minute timeout. Use the Grep tool (respects ignores) or exclude that path.

**`Start-Process -RedirectStandardOutput`/`-RedirectStandardError` overwrites the target file on every launch — it does not append.** A `restart_felix` mid-diagnosis destroys the only evidence of what just crashed. Copy `cerebral.err.log` aside before restarting anything you're actively debugging.

## A new plugin needs `cerebral/tests/test_plugin_<name>.py` or it boots silently disabled

`cerebral/main.py`'s live orchestrator is `MCPOrchestrator(verify_test_files=True)` (ADR-0034): any `plugins/<name>.py` without a file at exactly `cerebral/tests/test_plugin_<name>.py` (existence only, not content) is refused at registration with `REASON_NO_TEST_FILE` — no traceback, boot continues normally, and you only see it by grepping `cerebral.err.log` for `Refused plugin`. A bare `MCPOrchestrator()` in a smoke-test defaults `verify_test_files=False` and will NOT catch this — always pass `verify_test_files=True` when smoke-testing plugin discovery. This gate-satisfying file is separate from wherever the plugin's real test suite lives (e.g. `settings_control` has both `test_plugin_settings_control.py`, an ~18-line existence+one-guard-clause stub, and the full `test_settings_control.py`) — write a small real test for the stub file, not a placeholder, mirroring that pattern.
