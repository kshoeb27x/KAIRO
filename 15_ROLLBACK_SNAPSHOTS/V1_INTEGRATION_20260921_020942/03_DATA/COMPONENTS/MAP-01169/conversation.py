"""Conversation store -- the fifth memory tier (ADR-0007, Issue #185).

Persists per-profile chat turns to the same SQLite database as profiles /
queue / ACL. Mirrors the existing ``CredentialStore`` / ``ProfileManager``
shape: one class, owns its connection, ``_init_schema`` runs idempotent
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` at construct time so a fresh DB and a
migrated DB both end up valid.

S9 (#292) adds ``conversation_threads`` and a ``thread_id`` column on
``conversation_turns``. Existing turns are back-filled into one "Legacy"
thread per profile so the migration is non-destructive (ADR-0007).

S11 (#294) adds ``conversation_projects`` and a ``project_id`` column on
``conversation_threads``. "Unfiled" = ``project_id IS NULL``; deleting a
project sets its threads' ``project_id`` to NULL via ``ON DELETE SET NULL``
so we never lose conversation history when a folder is removed.

Retention is infinite in v1 (ADR-0007 / privacy debt acknowledged); the
manual-purge UX is a v2 deepening. Raw audio is never written -- only
post-Whisper text and Felix's response text.

        Log (S26/#879, decision #46). Unlike list_recent, this is not
        thread-scoped -- an activity stream is meant to be read across
        every thread the profile has, not just the currently-open one.

        Filters on the plaintext, indexed `kind` column only. content_json
        is encrypted (Fernet) -- a SQL LIKE against it cannot work at all
        (search_threads has that exact latent bug already; do not copy the
        pattern here). Sub-scoping by e.g. "trading only" is a `source` key
        inside the encrypted content, meant to be filtered in Python AFTER
        this kind filter has already cut the row count down, not as a
        second plaintext column -- that would leak what encryption-at-rest
        exists to protect.

        `since`, when given, must be in the same sortable string format as
        the `ts` column (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`'s default, `YYYY-MM-DD
        HH:MM:SS` -- second precision, not microsecond; plain lexicographic
        comparison works because that format sorts the same as it reads).
