"""
computer_use plugin -- ADR-0016 spine (Issue #574).

Felix sees a target app's window (UIA-first), decides what element to touch,
and drives OS-level mouse/keyboard against it, verifying each attempt against
the next observation with a retry limit. Windows-only in v1: fail-closed
elsewhere (import succeeds, tool calls return an error, no crash).

Tools (S1):
  read_ui       -- return the target window's UIA elements as text
                   (name, role, bbox) -- structured, not screenshot bytes.
  click_element -- observe -> click a named element -> verify (up to N tries).
  type_into     -- observe -> type into a named element -> verify (up to N).

Trace shape (returned in ToolResult.content and available to record_trace_fn):
  {
    "tool": "click_element" | "type_into" | "read_ui",
    "window_title": "...",
    "target": {"name": "...", "role": "...", "bbox": [l, t, r, b]} | null,
    "action": "click" | "type" | null,
    "tries": [
        {"n": 1, "observed": bool, "acted": bool,
         "expected": "...", "actual": "...", "ok": bool},
        ...
    ],
    "ok": bool,
  }

Raw frames are NEVER persisted (ADR-0016 audio-buffer rule). The Windows
backend can capture RAM-only bytes for future pixel-vision (S5) but this
slice does not call it; the seam exists so S5 doesn't have to reshape the
plugin.

Injection seams (test + import stay Windows-lib-free):
  backend         -- ComputerUseBackend Protocol; default is the Windows
                     UIA/pyautogui backend, or None on non-Windows.
  record_trace_fn -- optional callable(dict) -> None to persist a per-call
                     structured trace turn (wired by main.py -> Conversation
                     store as KIND_TOOL_RESULT). Never receives frame bytes.

Background actuation (ADR-0016 amendment 2026-08-02, Issue #592):
  click_element / type_into now try a UIA control pattern first (Invoke /
  Toggle / SelectionItem.Select / ExpandCollapse for clicks, ValuePattern.
  SetValue for text) -- no cursor move, no synthetic keystrokes, so the user
  keeps the mouse/keyboard while Felix drives. The live control is re-resolved
  just-in-time per try (``_resolve_element`` on the backend) and never carried
  across an ``await``. When no usable pattern exists, the SAME re-resolved
  element's bbox feeds the existing pyautogui foreground fallback. Each try
  records ``path``: ``"uia_pattern"`` (background), ``"uia_synthetic"``
  (today's foreground bbox click/type, keeps its old behaviour+name), or
  ``"pixel"`` (S5, unchanged). SetValue only fires on an allowlisted role
  (``computer_use.setvalue_roles``, default Edit/Document) outside a browser/
  Electron surface -- it fills, it never submits. Both knobs live in
  felix-settings.json as flat keys ``background_actuation`` (master, default
  on) and ``setvalue_roles`` (default ``["Edit", "Document"]``; empty forces
  all text through foreground typing while leaving pattern clicks background).
  Idle-gating the foreground fallback (#593) and live-verify docs (#595) are
  the other follow-on slices -- #595 is not built here.

Idle gate + focus-theft probe (ADR-0016 amendment d/g, Issue #593):
  Before ANY pyautogui foreground action -- the click_element/type_into
  fallback, browser_navigate, and the pixel-vision click -- the plugin
  checks ``GetLastInputInfo`` via the backend's ``last_input_ms()``. If the
  user touched input more recently than ``computer_use.user_idle_ms``
  (default 4000ms) they are PRESENT, so Felix does not grab input: the try
  is recorded as waiting and the existing observe-act-verify retry loop
  carries the wait, escalating to attended-handoff (S6) on exhaustion same
  as any other failure -- no new escalation path. Full-autonomy bypasses the
  gate exactly as it bypasses the irreversible floor (sec 4). Independently,
  every actuated try (pattern AND foreground) captures
  ``GetForegroundWindow()`` before/after via ``foreground_window()`` and
  stamps ``foregrounded: bool``. A BACKGROUND pattern action that
  unexpectedly foregrounds the target is a SOFT TRIP: the try is recorded
  failed and the call returns immediately -- it never falls through to the
  input-stealing foreground fallback. Both backend methods are optional:
  absent -> the gate always allows (unknown idle can't block) and
  ``foregrounded`` always stamps False (matches pre-#593 behaviour).

Mode-aware driving indicator (ADR-0016 amendment f, Issue #594):
  A background pattern action has no moving cursor, so the "Felix is
  driving" broadcast is its only feedback. ``_emit_driving`` therefore
  carries a payload -- not a bare bool -- with ``mode: "background" |
  "foreground"``, ``window_title``, and ``action`` alongside ``driving``.
  The initial guess for a click/type call is "background" when
  ``background_actuation`` is on (a pattern is attempted first), else
  "foreground"; ``browser_navigate`` has no control-pattern equivalent so it
  is always "foreground". The call sites re-emit with ``mode="foreground"``
  the moment a try actually falls through to the pyautogui fallback, and
  again immediately on a #593 soft trip -- so a focus-theft mid-action flips
  the live indicator to the foreground/urgent style in real time, same
  broadcast, no second gate. The ``irreversible``/``is_committing_action``
  gate is untouched (sec 3): this is visibility only.

Mode ladder + session-2 relaxations (ADR-0016 S16 #610):
  ``select_actuation_tier(needs_foreground, live_desktop_only)`` exposes the
  three-tier planner ladder: ``"background"`` (UIA control patterns, no
  cursor), ``"isolated_session"`` (Felix's dedicated session, default for
  foreground/pixel work), ``"take_turns"`` (live-desktop foreground, opt-in
  when a target exists ONLY in the user's session). Inside session 2 (i.e.
  when ``_session_dispatch_fn`` is wired -- ``_in_isolated_session()`` is
  True): the window-bounded region check and the foreground idle-gate are
  both dropped (full-desktop actions are allowed and there is no user cursor
  to yield to in session 2). screen_capture consent is silenced for session-2
  tool calls at the main.py capability-check layer. A ``FailureNotifyFn``
  seam is called whenever a dedicated-path dispatch raises (worker disconnect,
  session death) -- it fires before falling back to the local backend so the
  user is NEVER left in a silent-failure state. The consequence/irreversible
  modal is unchanged: committing actions still route through the ADR-0005
  modal regardless of session.
