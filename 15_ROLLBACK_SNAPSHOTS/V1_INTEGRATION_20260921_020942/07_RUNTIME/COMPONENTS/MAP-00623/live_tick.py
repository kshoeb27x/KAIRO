"""One live/paper dispatch tick: a validated strategy -> a real broker order.

THE CANONICAL LIVE STRATEGY CONTRACT
====================================
Decision #5 in TRADING.md says a strategy is ``def strategy(data) -> signals``.
That was never pinned down to anything concrete, and three incompatible
shapes drifted apart. This module pins the *live* one down and is the only
consumer of it:

``data``
    The pandas DataFrame ``cerebral.trading_data.fetch_ohlcv`` returns:
    ascending DatetimeIndex, columns ``Open/High/Low/Close/Volume``
    (capitalised, split/dividend adjusted). NOT a dict -- the stub generator
    in ``trading_ideas.py`` used to read ``data.get("close", [])``, which
    against that DataFrame silently returns the ``[]`` default (pandas'
    ``.get()`` treats a missing column as absent), i.e. every generated
    strategy produced no signals whatsoever. Fixed at the generator, pinned
    here.

``signals``
    A sequence of TARGET POSITIONS, one per bar, each ``1`` (want long),
    ``0`` (want flat) or ``-1`` (want short). Target state, not an action:
    the dispatcher diffs the LAST element against what the broker says it
    actually holds, so a missed tick, a partial fill or a Felix restart
    self-corrects on the next tick instead of double-entering. A sequence
    shorter than ``data`` is fine (indicator warm-up); the last element is
    always "what to hold now". An empty sequence means "no opinion" -> hold.

``run_gauntlet``'s batch ``backtest_func(prices, params) -> (equity, metrics)``
is deliberately NOT reconciled with this. Validating a whole history and
deciding one bar are different jobs with legitimately different shapes; this
module only owns the live path.
