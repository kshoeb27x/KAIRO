"""
Pipeline truthfulness audit for Jarvis — independent anti-fabrication layer.

The agent pipeline already defends against fabricated results at runtime
(task_runtime._detect_fabricated_execution injects a RUNTIME WARNING, and an
LLM verifier scores each output). This module is the *independent* second line:
it does NOT trust the LLM verifier. It re-checks the persisted record with
deterministic invariants and maintains a tamper-evident ledger, so that
"the results are real, not hallucinated" is provable after the fact rather
than taken on the verifier's word.

Distinct from infra/security_audit.py:
  - security_audit answers "was this action authorized?"
  - pipeline_audit answers "is this result real, or faked?"

Inputs (READ-ONLY — this module never mutates pipeline state):
  - ~/.jarvis/verifier_verdicts.jsonl   (override: JARVIS_VERDICTS_PATH)
  - ~/.jarvis/projects.db               (override: JARVIS_PROJECTS_DB) [optional]

Output (this module's own append-only artifact):
  - ~/.jarvis/pipeline_audit.jsonl      (override: JARVIS_PIPELINE_AUDIT_PATH)

Tamper-evidence comes from two mechanisms:
  1. Each audit run appends one record whose `this_hash` chains the previous
     record's hash (sha256(prev_hash + canonical(record))). Editing any past
     ledger record breaks the chain on the next run -> LEDGER_TAMPERED.
  2. Each run stores a prefix hash of the verdict log it has already audited.
     If a previously-seen verdict line is later edited or deleted, the prefix
     hash stops matching -> VERDICT_LOG_MUTATED. This makes the *upstream*
     evidence tamper-evident even though this module cannot write to it.

CLI:
    python -m infra.pipeline_audit --once        # audit, print report, append ledger
    python -m infra.pipeline_audit --watch        # loop, re-audit on verdict-log change
    python -m infra.pipeline_audit --once --json  # machine-readable report
Exit code: 0 = clean, 1 = warnings only, 2 = at least one critical.
