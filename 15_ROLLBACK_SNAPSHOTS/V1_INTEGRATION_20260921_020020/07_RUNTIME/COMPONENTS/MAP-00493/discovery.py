        untrusted *generated strategy code*, not for Felix's own logic
        scanning a symbol list, and batching untrusted evaluation through
        argv is mechanically impossible on Windows regardless).

        The candidate universe is the growing watchlist PLUS the ~20-symbol
        known-liquid set extract_ticker() already trusts (never an
        unbounded universe sweep -- decision #36 stands), watchlist entries
        first. Fix (2026-08-26): this used to return ONLY the watchlist
        once it had anything on it at all, permanently excluding the
        known-liquid set from that point on -- confirmed live, a watchlist
        seeded with 3 symbols stayed stuck at exactly those 3 for over a
        day of real passes, since nothing pattern-general ever got a
        chance to introduce a new one. Always including the known-liquid
        set keeps fresh candidates in the running so the pool can actually
        widen over time (each one dispatched here gets upsert()'d into the
        watchlist by process_idea, same as any other candidate).

        `rank_fn` (optional, injected -- see rank_for_day_trading) orders
        that universe by actual day-trading fitness (liquidity + intraday
        range) instead of raw watchlist-then-alphabetical order. Omitted
        (the default, and every pre-existing caller/test) keeps watchlist
        entries first, in their natural recency order, known-liquid
        overflow after. A rank_fn that returns nothing (e.g. every
        candidate failed its liquidity floor) falls back to the unranked
        universe rather than returning zero candidates.

        Fix (2026-08-31): the 2026-08-26 fix above stopped helping the
        moment the watchlist grew past `limit` entries -- `universe[:limit]`
        is just `existing[:limit]` once len(existing) >= limit, so overflow
        became permanently unreachable again, silently. Confirmed live: a
        watchlist that reached 14 entries within days stayed at exactly
        those 14 for the following three, every idea's top candidates
        being whichever 3 watchlist symbols were screened most recently.
        Reserving the LAST slot for the next un-seen known-liquid symbol
        (only once existing has filled every other slot) keeps the pool
        widening a little every pass without diluting the existing
        symbols' own priority -- they still fill every slot but the last.
