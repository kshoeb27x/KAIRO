The operator-facing lifecycle terminator: it owns session lifecycle, quota, the session denylist, and the kill-switch, reachable only on operator/lifecycle ingress and never from the agent-facing MCP surface. Audience: engineers wiring the operator plane or auditing the kill-switch path.

# Component-02: Control / operator API

## Purpose

Owns session lifecycle, quota, the session denylist, and the kill-switch ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §3). It is the operator side of the Control plane split into two runnable units so the kill-switch is unreachable from the agent path by network policy rather than an in-process guard; it is the sole author of the session denylist that the Egress trust-edge reads and that the Control plane checks host-side on every Compute-plane control RPC (`F6`) ([`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §7).

## Boundaries

Intra-container, this is one process with three internal components behind a single operator/lifecycle ingress that is a distinct deployable from the MCP gateway:

| Internal component | What it does |
|---|---|
| lifecycle controller | terminates session create/status/destroy (gateway service identity) and operator session ops; host-dials the Session sandbox to set up and tear down |
| denylist + kill-switch authority | terminates operator force-kill, denylist edits, and signed SOAR revoke; authors the denylist and signals a host-initiated stop |
| quota accountant | checks per-caller create-rate and per-tenant counters on create; refuses excess |

The operator/lifecycle ingress, the SOAR-revoke ingress, the gateway→Control session set-up edge, the Control→Session sandbox host-dial, and the Control→Audit fan-in are the boundaries `05-c4-container.md` §4 names (their `F2`/`F4`/`F5`/`F6`/`F10` flow labels are defined in [`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §4); this spec adds only which internal component terminates each.

Owned state: the session registry (live sessions, their `container_name` binding, tenant, quota counters) and the denylist (kill-switch state), of which this container is sole custodian — no other component can mutate either, and the guest holds no handle that reaches them. It provably does NOT hold an upstream credential or backend storage key (the upstream credential reaches the Egress trust-edge over Envoy SDS; the backend storage key sits with the Storage broker, [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §2), and holds no Storage-mount handle.

Token classes ([`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §8 owns the taxonomy and TTLs): this container mints the Session JWT (per-session, bound to `container_name`) toward the Session sandbox on the host-dialled control channel, accepts a Generic internal token authenticating the inbound gateway service identity on session set-up, and accepts an operator credential on ingress (the operator-auth substrate is fixed by [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-operator-authentication-substrate.md)). The wire surface is unfrozen: the operator REST and SOAR-revoke surfaces (OpenAPI 3.1) and the gateway→Control session set-up RPC (Protobuf/gRPC) are OCU-`define` in [`08-contracts.md`](../08-contracts.md) §1, but their schema files are not yet built ([#205](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/205)), so `contract: null`. Two listeners back this container — operator/lifecycle ingress and gateway service-identity ingress; the kill-switch route exists only on the former. The customer-IdP assertion on ingress is relying-party, not an OCU-defined surface.

## Invariants

Each holds independent of the caller and is falsifiable by the named check. Cross-cutting properties (zone membership, in-transit encryption, retention floor, isolation tier) are Layer 3 and not restated.

- No MCP-surface route resolves to a lifecycle, denylist, or kill-switch route, and no rendered deploy manifest grants the gateway a network route to the operator ingress on either shelf (IaC-policy assertion, NFR-SEC-52).
- The kill-switch and revoke path holds its SLA while the control plane is saturated, including a flood on the operator/SOAR ingress itself; the lifecycle/revoke route carries reserved capacity or admission priority distinct from the create path (chaos test with an adversarial concurrent-load dimension, NFR-SEC-55, with the ≤30 s p99 value owned by NFR-SEC-01).
- A body-supplied session/tenant/`container_name` id is a hint, never the authority; the binding the host acts on (the host-dial, the registry write) is host-derived, so a gateway or guest naming another session's id cannot bind or address it (integration-test: forge-another-session attempt fails, NFR-SEC-43).
- The gateway service identity reaching this container carries no operator scope; force-kill, denylist edit, and quota override are unreachable with that audience (unit + integration-test on the audience-to-route map, NFR-SEC-26).
- Every privileged operator/SOAR action in the NFR-SEC-45 enumerated set emits a chain-linked OCSF event before acknowledgement, and the action is denied if the audit write fails (fail-closed); the enumerated set is the versioned fixture owned by NFR-SEC-45, with system-initiated lifecycle transitions owned by NFR-SEC-72 (per-release integration-test driving every action + a negative test asserting deny on audit-sink failure, NFR-SEC-45).
- Per-caller create-rate and per-tenant quota are enforced before a session is created; excess is refused, not queued, and agent-side create flooding cannot starve the operator/revoke route because the two ingresses are distinct (quota integration + connection-flood chaos test, NFR-COST-06, NFR-SEC-53).
- All TTL and revocation windows (Session JWT, denylist propagation) are computed against a monotonic clock immune to wall-clock setback; a setback ≥ a window neither extends a token nor defers a revoke (red-team clock-rollback harness, NFR-SEC-48).

## Failure modes

Each row traces to one P2 STRIDE row in [`06-threat-model.md`](../06-threat-model.md) §3 and repeats that row's controlling NFR; fail-closed is the default on the denylist, revoke, and audit-write boundaries. A1 is the in-sandbox guest; A2 is the external caller / gateway service identity; A3 is the operator/SOAR principal.

| Trace | Reaching actor | What goes wrong | Recovery behaviour | Controlling NFR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-E1 | A2, A1 | Agent-path principal probes for an operator or kill-switch route | No lifecycle/kill-switch route resolves; gateway→operator-ingress reachability is denied at deploy time and a missed route fails CI, not runtime | NFR-SEC-52 |
| P2-T2 | A1 | Guest stalls or drops the host-dialled control RPC to defeat the stop | The denylist is read host-side and the kill-switch is a host-initiated stop, not a cooperative guest action; an unreachable channel grants no new authority (fail-closed) | NFR-SEC-01 |
| P2-D1 | A2, A1 | Concurrent flood of session-create and operator/SOAR calls aims to starve revoke | The create path sheds at the per-caller/per-tenant quota and fails-closed; the revoke route holds reserved capacity so the kill-switch stays within SLA, with RTO/RPO the post-failure backstop | NFR-SEC-55, NFR-REL-01 |
| P2-R1 | A3, A2 | Operator force-kill / denylist edit / quota override leaves no independent record | The action is denied if its audit event fails to write; it does not take effect un-recorded | NFR-SEC-45 |
| P2-R2 | A2 | SOAR revoke disputed or replayed | The call is verified by signature against the SOAR principal before acting and emits an OCSF event bound to that principal; an unverifiable call is rejected | NFR-COMP-27, NFR-SEC-45 |
| P2-I1 | A2, A3 | Registry/quota enumeration across tenants | Audience-scoping returns only the caller's own sessions and host-attested binding blocks cross-session reads; the control plane carries no customer payload | NFR-IC-04 |

Residual, by [`06-threat-model.md`](../06-threat-model.md) §5 register: the stop-SLA accounting behind P2-T2 assumes a trustworthy host clock — trusted-time theme, [#185](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/185). Saturation/spill behaviour and a measurable containment target for P2-D1 fold into the resource-exhaustion theme, [#188](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/188). The mandatorily-audited action set behind P2-R1/P2-R2 is the privileged-operator-audit theme tracked at [#186](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/186). The no-customer-payload gate behind P2-I1 is not yet a measurable target, [#149](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/149).

The denylist this container authors also gates the Egress trust-edge: a revoked session is refused lease injection at the edge (the deny-signal half of [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §7). That enforcement behaviour lives in the Egress trust-edge spec; here the invariant is only sole authorship of the denylist the edge reads.

## Operational concerns

Config surface: the operator/lifecycle ingress listener and the gateway service-identity listener are distinct network endpoints (the NFR-SEC-52 separation); per-caller create-rate, per-tenant concurrent-session and calls/min ceilings (NFR-COST-06), and the reserved lifecycle/revoke capacity (NFR-SEC-55) are the principal knobs. Observability: this container emits OCSF on the audit fan-in for session create/destroy, every enumerated privileged action (NFR-SEC-45), and quota rejections, into the hash-chained pipeline ([`audit/audit-fanin`](../../../contracts/audit/audit-fanin.asyncapi.yaml), NFR-SEC-03); the audit-write is on the critical path of a privileged action (fail-closed), not a side-channel. Scaling axis: one instance per deployment (not per session); the single-instance minimal shelf is in scope for the kill-switch-under-saturation target (NFR-SEC-55), so the capacity model reserves admission priority for the revoke route rather than scaling out, and RTO/RPO of this plane is NFR-REL-01. Upgrade/rotation: the RPC surface (session create/destroy/exec/fs) is versioned — a breaking change requires a major version plus deprecation header, CI-enforced by `buf breaking` / `oasdiff` (NFR-IC-04, [`08-contracts.md`](../08-contracts.md) §4); Session JWT rotation is mint-fresh-before-expiry, not extension, on the JWT TTL window in [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §8.

Shelf delta ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §5): the minimal shelf co-locates this container with a host-rooted local operator credential and a host-local Session-JWT signing key; the full shelf schedules it with a customer-IdP-asserted operator identity (NFR-COMP-29) and a customer-PKI-rooted signer. The invariants above are boundary properties and hold on both shelves; only the operator-auth substrate and the JWT signer change, never the gateway↛operator separation, the host-attested binding, or the fail-closed audit-write. Retention of the audit events this container emits is the platform floor owned by the Audit pipeline (NFR-COMP-01). The operator-auth substrate is fixed by [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-operator-authentication-substrate.md).

## Open questions

1. Minimum scope of the gateway's internal token on the session set-up edge, and per-tool/per-action authorization on operator actions — [#187](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/187).
2. Measurable no-customer-payload gate on the control plane — [#149](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/149).
3. Saturation/spill behaviour and a measurable containment target for the create and operator/SOAR ingress under sustained adversarial load — [#188](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/188).
4. Trusted-time floor for Session-JWT TTL and denylist-propagation windows — [#185](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/185).
5. Operator-auth substrate (PAM-JIT integration, full vs minimal shelf) is fixed by [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-operator-authentication-substrate.md); the multi-party-approval residual is tracked at [#225](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/225).
