Template for a component specification, used by `next/v1` engineers when adding a new component to the architecture.

# Component-NN: <name>

## Purpose

One sentence: what role does this component play, and for whom? No marketing tone.

## Boundaries

What crosses in, what crosses out, what state does this component own.

| Direction | What | From / to | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|

If the table has fewer than three rows, use prose.

## Invariants

The rules this component upholds, independent of its caller. Each invariant is enforceable by a test.

## Failure modes

What can go wrong, how it manifests, what the recovery contract is.

## Operational concerns

Configuration, observability, scaling axis, capacity model, upgrade discipline. Cite the relevant ADRs.

## Open questions

Capped at 5. Each entry links to a GitHub issue. If you hit 6, either resolve one or promote it to an ADR.
