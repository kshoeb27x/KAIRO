Internal design of the per-session execution container, for engineers implementing and auditing the guest agent and its host-side edges. The guest agent is the process that constitutes this container ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §3): it is PID 1 and dies with the session.

# Component-05: Session sandbox

## Purpose

Executes one session's tool-calls in an isolated runtime that holds no standing upstream secret and reaches the network only through the Egress trust-edge ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §3). Spec scope is the intra-container split — the guest agent, the host-side exec supervisor, and the mount and egress edges the guest sees — not the inter-container flows Layer 6 already fixes.

## Boundaries

Intra-container, the container is one process tree rooted at the guest agent (PID 1). Two host-side mediators sit outside the guest's network yet terminate the channels the guest uses: a per-session exec supervisor (terminates the exec WebSocket, spawns and reaps guest processes, bounds stdio) and the runtime supervisor (the user-space-kernel sentry on the gVisor tier, the VMM on the microVM tier, the host kernel on runc). The mount and egress edges are owned by other containers (Storage broker, Egress trust-edge); the guest holds only the handle and the route, never the credential.

| Direction | What crosses | Internal terminator | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| host → guest | exec/PTY+CDP control union + stdin frames | exec supervisor (host-dialled; non-host peer dropped at accept) | one WebSocket per session; envelope frozen in [`exec/exec-channel`](../../../contracts/exec/exec-channel.schema.json) |
| guest → host | stdout/stderr binary frames + result/EOF | exec supervisor | length-prefixed, bounded per call (Invariants) |
| host → guest | Session JWT (selects session identity) | guest agent | Session JWT class, TTL per [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §8 |
| broker → guest | file-operation mount + Storage-mount handle | guest agent (mount client) | guest names file-op verbs, never the object-store protocol; substrate is named by role |
| guest → edge | outbound network leg | guest agent | guest carries no long-lived upstream secret on this leg; the edge attaches upstream authorization ([ADR-0005](../adr/0005-egress-credential-delivery-envoy-sds.md), [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-egress-auth-mechanism.md)) keyed on a presented scoped credential, never on the route's network origin; this route is the container's sole egress (invariant 4) |
| guest → audit | OCSF tool-call events (fan-in flow F10, defined in [`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §4) | exec supervisor / runtime-monitor | host-authored, not guest-authored (Operational concerns) |

The inbound exec/PTY+CDP edge, the broker mount edge, and the outbound egress leg are the boundaries [`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §4 names; their `F6`/`F7`/`F8` flow labels are defined in [`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §4.

Owned state: the live process tree and its scratch/tmpfs, the per-process resource counters the exec supervisor keeps, and the guest's in-memory Session JWT and Storage-mount handle for the life of the session. It provably does NOT hold any upstream/backend credential, the Custody credential lease, the session denylist, or any kill-switch route — those sit host-side of the guest. The guest resolves no name for the Control plane or the Storage broker; those are reached over the host-opened off-network channel, so no guest-side lookup exists to retarget.

The contract carries the tagged-JSON control union and out-of-band binary stdio frames; field types and the bounded-reason error envelope live in the schema and are not restated. The schema does not encode two facts: the exec supervisor — not the guest — terminates the socket, and the runtime tier is selected by `workload_trust_profile`, not by the contract. The schema records the spawn-time environment fields; it does not pin which component enforces the strip — that actor is the host supervisor (Invariants).

## Invariants

Each is falsifiable by the named check; cross-cutting zone, egress-mode, retention, and isolation-tier-menu properties stay in Layer 3.

1. The guest agent is PID 1 and the container holds no process or token that outlives the session; teardown kills the process tree and destroys the cgroup (integration-test, NFR-REL-11).
2. The exec/PTY+CDP channel is a single host-dialled socket per session; a connection from any non-host peer is dropped at accept before any frame is parsed (accept-time negative-test, NFR-SEC-76 — the accept-time enforcement of NFR-SEC-43, scoped here to the Control listener).
3. Guest-originated code cannot reach the control/exec channel through the guest's own network stack, and a guest with in-sandbox root cannot present another session's identity (integration negative-test: guest-stack dial fails, forge-another-session fails — NFR-SEC-43).
4. The container has exactly one outbound network route and it is the Egress trust-edge; there is no second NIC or route (IaC-policy assertion, NFR-SEC-27).
5. Inter-sandbox reachability is disabled by default; tenant A's sandbox cannot reach tenant B's without an explicit policy (NetworkPolicy + integration-test, NFR-SEC-22).
6. Every container carries `no-new-privileges`, cap-drop ALL with minimal add-back, seccomp BPF, read-only rootfs, user-namespace mapping (host UID 0 ≠ guest UID 0), and pids/cpu/mem cgroup limits; `docker.sock` is never mounted (admission-gate, NFR-SEC-14).
7. The configured runtime tier matches the deployment's declared `workload_trust_profile` per the pairing matrix; a mismatch is an admission-time hard error (admission test fixture, NFR-SEC-38).
8. A guest-spawned process inherits no host secret: the host supervisor strips the deny-pattern env set (`*_TOKEN`/`*_SECRET`/`*_PASSWORD`/`API_KEY`) at fork and injects only declared vars; no secret rides on argv (spawn-time fixture + property-test, NFR-SEC-75).
9. Per-stream stdout/stderr over the exec channel is framed, length-prefixed, and bounded per call; on reaching the ceiling the supervisor stops forwarding, emits a truncation marker with a dropped-byte count, and never buffers unbounded guest output into host memory or the audit pipeline (red-team output-flood suite, NFR-SEC-74).
10. Per-sandbox resource use is contained beyond the cgroup ceiling — scratch disk quota and deterministic OOM scoping (the breaching sandbox is the victim) — so one sandbox's flood holds co-resident sandboxes within the noisy-neighbour latency budget (red-team noisy-neighbour suite, NFR-SEC-46).
11. No session-scoped secret is present in guest RAM or disk at snapshot-create time, and on resume the guest re-derives a fresh host-attested identity and reseeds entropy and unique IDs so no two guests restored from one image share a token, nonce, RNG stream, or `boot_id` (offline image-extraction scan + N-fork uniqueness test, NFR-SEC-44 + NFR-SEC-71).
12. Every TTL/expiry decision the guest is subject to reads a monotonic clock immune to wall-clock setback, and on resume the wall clock is corrected before any time-bound check runs (red-team clock-rollback harness, NFR-SEC-48 + NFR-SEC-63 — theme [#185](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/185), owned by [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md)).

## Failure modes

Each row traces to one P5 STRIDE row in [`06-threat-model.md`](../06-threat-model.md) §3.1 and repeats that row's controlling NFR; the threat narrative, rating, and regulator cell stay there. A1 (the in-sandbox guest holding root) is the reaching actor for the §3.1 rows; A3 (post-escape or host foothold) for the at-rest snapshot row.

| Trace | Reaching actor | Container-internal recovery behaviour | Controlling NFR |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-T2 | A1 | Guest stalls or drops the host-dialled control RPC to outlive a revoke/kill. Recovery is owned by the Control/operator API ([`02-control-operator-api.md`](02-control-operator-api.md)): the F6 denylist/kill-switch check is host-side, so an unreachable channel grants the guest no new authority. | NFR-SEC-01 |
| P5-D1 | A1 | Guest exhausts node resources (fork-bomb, disk fill, memory pressure). Fail-closed via the cgroup PID/CPU/mem ceiling plus scratch quota and deterministic OOM scoping — the offender is the OOM/quota victim, co-residents hold SLO. Residual: per-session quota precision — resource-exhaustion theme [#188](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/188). | NFR-SEC-14 + NFR-SEC-46 + NFR-SEC-74 |
| P5-D2 | A1 | Guest floods the edge to deny outbound for itself and co-tenants. Single forward route, deny-by-default; fail-closed drops outbound if the proxy is unreachable rather than bypassing. Residual: per-session egress rate-limit unstated — resource-exhaustion theme [#188](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/188). | NFR-SEC-05 + NFR-SEC-27 |
| P5-I1 | A1 | Guest mounts a microarchitectural side-channel against a co-resident tenant. Per-tier posture: the shared-kernel residual is declared-not-eliminated; the reduced tier pins SMT-off, current microcode, and single-tenant scheduling for flagged sessions. Residual: a measurable cross-tenant target — side-channel theme [#183](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/183), [#148](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/148). | NFR-SEC-58 |
| P5-I3 | A1 | Guest tunnels tenant data to an allow-listed destination over the content-blind transparent pass-through rung. The container's only recovery is a single deny-by-default forward route plus a payload-independent egress-byte / destination-cardinality tripwire emitted to audit and SOAR; deep content inspection runs on the egress-wide-bump leg ([ADR-0007](../adr/0007-egress-auth-mechanism.md)), owned by the Egress trust-edge ([`06-egress-trust-edge.md`](06-egress-trust-edge.md), F8). Residual: content-blind transparent egress — theme [#182](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/182). | NFR-SEC-57 |
| P5-I4 | A1 | A guest-spawned process inherits a host-env secret, or a secret on argv leaks via `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. Allowlist-only env injection with the deny-pattern strip at fork; secrets pass via env or fd, never argv. | NFR-SEC-75 + NFR-SEC-43 |
| P5-T1 | A1 | With root the guest suppresses, fabricates, or reorders the OCSF events it would author for its own in-sandbox actions. The guest is never the authoritative source: a host-side mediation layer and a not-guest-disableable runtime-monitor session author the record out of band. Residual: purely in-sandbox actions with no host-side side-effect — guest-self-audit theme [#181](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/181). | NFR-SEC-47 |
| P5-R1 | A1 | An in-sandbox action cannot be non-repudiably attributed because its only candidate record originates inside the guest. Out-of-band host-authored evidence supplies the record and the monotonic-clock envelope orders accepted events. Residual: the in-sandbox-evidence gap (theme [#181](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/181)) plus the clock-trust dependency (theme [#185](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/185)). | NFR-SEC-47 + NFR-SEC-48 |
| P5-I2 | A3 | A snapshot/hibernation image freezes a live Session JWT and mount handle at rest; an image read recovers a usable token before TTL. The image is taken at minimal-init before session material is layered, live token buffers are zeroized before a retained hibernate, and a single-restore guard prevents fork replay. Residual: a live secret in an off-cycle image — snapshot theme [#184](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/184). | NFR-SEC-44 + NFR-SEC-66 |

The host-facing default is fail-closed on every boundary the guest can pressure: an unreachable exec channel, a dropped egress route, and a failed teardown each deny authority rather than degrade open. Sandbox escape to the host kernel and the exec/PTY+CDP channel-spoof variants are MITIGATED in [`06-threat-model.md`](../06-threat-model.md) §4 (NFR-SEC-02/14, NFR-SEC-43) and are not live rows here.

## Operational concerns

Scaling axis is per session — one container per session `[1..N]`, lifecycle bound to the session ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §3). Capacity is governed by the host substrate and the per-sandbox cgroup ceiling (NFR-SEC-14); session-create targets ≤500 ms p99 warm-pool-hit (NFR-PERF-02), ≤2 s p99 cold-start (NFR-PERF-03), with ≤400 ms p99 on the user-space-kernel substrate (NFR-PERF-08). Compute-plane RTO for new sessions is ≤30 min with in-flight state non-durable (NFR-REL-02); stateful hibernate/resume/snapshot/fork is demonstrated end-to-end (NFR-REL-08). Cooperative shutdown is `terminationGracePeriodSeconds=30`, SIGTERM→5 s→SIGKILL, tmpdir clean ≤10 s (NFR-REL-11); teardown then runs a host-driven ordered finalizer that revokes the lease, drops the outbound route, and scrubs writable surfaces before kill, independent of guest cooperation (NFR-SEC-65). A guest that ran a session is destroyed, never re-pooled (NFR-SEC-68); a warm-pool claim re-derives a fresh host-attested identity and discards the pre-warm placeholder (NFR-SEC-69).

Config surface: the runtime tier (set by `workload_trust_profile`, validated at admission — NFR-SEC-38), the cgroup/quota ceilings (NFR-SEC-14, NFR-SEC-46), the per-stream stdio ceiling (default ≤8 MiB/stream, retunable per tier — NFR-SEC-74), the spawn-time env allowlist (NFR-SEC-75), and the exec-channel capability flags negotiated in the handshake (trace, compression — see the contract). Concurrency on the exec channel is sequential-default with opt-in parallelism (NFR-IC-05); PTY and CDP multiplex one socket per session (NFR-IC-03).

Observability: the container emits OCSF on fan-in flow F10, but the in-sandbox tool-call events are host-authored by the exec supervisor and the runtime-monitor — never the guest — per the audit contract and NFR-SEC-47 + NFR-SEC-03; the guest is not a trusted audit source for its own actions. A tier-downgrade of a running deployment fires `config.trust_profile.downgraded` within ≤30 s (NFR-SEC-39).

Shelf delta ([`05-c4-container.md`](../05-c4-container.md) §5, [`02-trust-boundaries.md`](../02-trust-boundaries.md) §8): the boundary invariants above hold on both shelves and only the substrate changes. The runtime supervisor that backs invariants 2–3, 9, and 11 is the host kernel with UDS peer-credential checks on the container tiers and the VMM with vsock on the microVM tier; the predicates (host-dialled channel, bounded stdio, no live secret in the image) do not change. The runtime-tier substrate and packaging pick is a future ADR; the FLEX-02 runtime ladder fixes the tier set, not the implementation.

## Open questions

1. Does the Session sandbox stay one container with internal components, or split into sub-containers once the workload-trust tier and guest-agent protocol are specified? — [#174](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/174).
2. Is workload-trust tier grading (`workload_trust_profile`, AP-13) a sub-context of its own, distinct from the session-lifecycle language inside Agent Execution? — [#168](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/168).
3. A measurable cross-tenant side-channel target on the shared-kernel tier ("tenant A cannot observe tenant B") is not yet an NFR scenario. — [#183](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/183), [#148](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/148).
4. Out-of-band evidence for purely in-sandbox actions with no host-side side-effect, and host-attested binding of the OCSF source at ingestion. — [#181](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/181).
5. Deterministic per-session erasure ordering and the live-secret-in-off-cycle-image residual on teardown/snapshot. — [#184](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/184).
