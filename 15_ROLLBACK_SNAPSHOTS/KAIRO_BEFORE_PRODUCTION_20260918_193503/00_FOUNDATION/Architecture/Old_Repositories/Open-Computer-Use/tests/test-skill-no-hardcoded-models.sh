# Phase 2 D-16: enforces no-hardcoded-model-names invariant for sub-agent skill files.
# Greps for forbidden tokens; lines wrapped in <!-- canonical-example -->...<!-- /canonical-example -->
# markers (or otherwise containing "canonical-example") are excluded — those are
# narrative examples that legitimately need to name a model (e.g., claude's `sonnet` baseline).
# Lines that mention "list-subagent-models" are also excluded (the script name itself
# contains "models" but does not encode a hardcoded model id).
