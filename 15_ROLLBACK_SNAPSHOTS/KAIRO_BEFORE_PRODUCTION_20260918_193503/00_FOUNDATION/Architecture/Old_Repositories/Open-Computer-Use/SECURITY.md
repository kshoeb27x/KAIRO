# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use the GitHub **private vulnerability reporting** form:
[Wide-Moat/open-computer-use → Security → Advisories → New advisory](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/security/advisories/new)

Do not open a public issue or pull request for a security problem. Public disclosure happens after the fix lands and (where applicable) a CVE is published.

## What's in scope

- Code in this repository on the `main` and `next/v1` branches.
- Container images we publish to GHCR.
- Helm chart we publish.

## What's not in scope

- Third-party dependencies — report upstream (we will track and patch).
- Vulnerabilities in customer deployments unless the root cause is in our code.

## Response timeline

We aim for:

- Acknowledgement of receipt: ≤ 3 business days.
- Initial severity assessment: ≤ 5 business days.
- Patch + advisory for a confirmed vulnerability:
  - Critical with active exploitation: ≤ 30 days from confirmation.
  - Other Critical / High: ≤ 90 days from confirmation, matching the
    GitHub Security Advisory default coordinated-disclosure window.

A faster patch is always possible — these are upper bounds, not targets.

## Supported versions

Each release of the Software is licensed under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 and automatically converts to Apache-2.0 two years after publication.

We patch security issues on `main` and `next/v1`. We may back-port fixes for confirmed Critical/High to the two most recent minor releases at maintainer discretion. Older minors are best-effort and not contractually supported.

## Coordinated disclosure

We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). Once a fix is available and customers have had ≥ 30 days to upgrade, the advisory is made public with credit to the reporter (if requested).
