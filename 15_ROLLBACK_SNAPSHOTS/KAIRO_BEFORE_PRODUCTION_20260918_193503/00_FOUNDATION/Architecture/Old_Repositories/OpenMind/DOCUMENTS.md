# DOCUMENTS.md -- Documents capability campaign driver

Design: `docs/adr/0011-docx-ground-truth-editor.md` + CONTEXT.md ("Document library",
"Resume artifact"). Grilled 2026-07-19. One engine (LibreOffice) is editor, edit
engine, and converter; documents live inside Felix's Document library; the resume
becomes one library document with derived PDF + dossier.

## SAFETY

- NEVER install software in a loop session: no winget, no downloads. The LibreOffice
  install happens only when the USER runs scripts/setup-libreoffice.ps1 themselves.
- NEVER invoke a real soffice.exe / LibreOffice / UNO bridge in tests or smoke runs.
  All conversion/edit/launch calls go through injectable seams and are stubbed.
  Behaviour only checkable with real LibreOffice -> APPEND a checklist item to
  docs/documents-live-verify.md instead of performing it.
- NEVER touch files on the user's Desktop. A pending resume correction
  (adam_poder_resume_AdamPoder8.docx) lives there and is owned by another session.
- NEVER fetch a live job board, drive a real ATS, or submit anything -- same rules
  as the jobs campaigns.
- Seam rule (#153/#385): no `from plugins.<x> import ...` inside cerebral/ -- wire
  through _wire_plugin_seams against _orc.get_plugin_module. Keep
  cerebral/tests/test_jobs_seam_wiring.py passing.
- Tray renderer is no-nodeIntegration: new panel logic uses the UMD-ish dual-mode
  wrapper in tray/lib/*.js (PR #203 pattern).
- Operator .ps1 scripts: ASCII-only bodies, pause-on-exit + -NoPause switch
  (CLAUDE.md rules).
