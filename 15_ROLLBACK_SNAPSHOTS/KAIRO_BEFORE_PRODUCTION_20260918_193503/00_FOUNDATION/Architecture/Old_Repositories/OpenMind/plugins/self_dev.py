"""
Self-dev plugin -- ADR-0015 S1/S2/S4/S5 (Issues #554/#555/#557/#807).

Felix's self-dev loop: clone the repo, branch, have the model make a scoped
edit, run the test suite inside the ADR-0010 sandbox, and open a PR.

S2 adds self_dev_load: after a self-dev PR is merged to master, pull the live
repo (git pull --ff-only) and broadcast restart_felix to the tray so the
merged change goes live. No-op if already up-to-date.

S4 originally added a blast-radius gate (ADR-0015 decision 5): a guardrail
file in the diff, or red tests, escalated to human review instead of merging.
The 2026-08-21 "full auto-merge" amendment removed that block entirely.
2026-08-22 tightening: test status is gated again -- a run whose tests don't
pass (including tests that fail to even collect) opens its PR but does not
merge, returning merge_decision "tests_failed" instead. This reverses only
the test half of the amendment: it was letting genuinely broken code onto
master silently (PR #840 merged with an uncollectable test suite -- a missing
dependency; PR #842 merged with a Monte Carlo gate that was statistically
meaningless as written). Guardrail-path hits remain informational only, per
the original amendment -- detection (is_guardrail_diff / GUARDRAIL_PATHS)
still runs and is recorded as a system_event, but doesn't block merge on its
own. The safety net for a bad self-merge that DOES land is the launcher's
boot self-check + SHA/DB rollback (tray/lib/boot-check.js, SD-3), independent
of this gate and still runs on every self-dev restart.

Issue #780 wires cerebral.llm.step_ledger.StepLedger into _run: each completed
phase (clone / edit / test / pr) is recorded keyed by run_id. Re-invoking with
the same run_id resumes from the ledger -- already-recorded phases are reused
instead of re-run (the model-driven edit is the expensive, stochastic one this
protects). The ledger, not clone-directory existence, is the resume signal:
clone dirs are deliberately kept after a run (operator preference -- last
run's tree is reference material), so a bare leftover dir with no ledger
entries is stale, not resumable, and still gets today's refusal. To
deliberately abandon a stuck/poisoned run_id, pass `restart: true`: it clears
the recorded phases AND removes the stale clone dir, so the run starts over
from scratch. (The underlying `StepLedger.clear(run_id)` is still available
via the injectable `ledger` seam for programmatic use.)

S5 (#807) adds self_dev_campaign: drives the existing _run() internals in a
loop against a campaign driver file (Status: / - **Active:** Sx -- #N /
- **Model:** / ## Queue / ## Landed PRs). Same driver-file format as the
scripts/run-<campaign>.ps1 external loop. Per-slice issue spec fetched via
injectable issue_fn seam (never real gh in tests). Stops immediately on error,
setting Status: blocked; every slice auto-merges per the amended decision 5
above (_run always returns merge_decision "auto_merge" now), so a campaign
runs slice-to-slice unattended unless a run itself errors out.

Injected seams (clone_fn / edit_fn / test_fn / pr_fn / diff_fn / merge_fn /
pull_fn / restart_fn / issue_fn / ledger) make the whole flow hermetic in
tests -- no real git / gh / network / Cerebral.

# ADR-0005 / Issue #554 -- self_dev clones the repo (shell_exec via sandbox),
# writes to the sandbox workdir (fs_write), and opens a PR via gh
# (network_egress_cloud). shell_exec is DENY by default (ADR-0005) -- self_dev
# is deny-by-default and unavailable where no sandbox backend exists
# (fail-closed, same posture as shell_exec / ADR-0010).
#
# fs_delete (#780 follow-up): `restart: true` removes the stale clone dir via
# shutil.rmtree so a poisoned run can start over. The AST-completeness check
# (#47) caught this as an undeclared capability -- declaring it is the honest
# fix, since the plugin genuinely deletes from the sandbox workdir now. The
# effective gate posture is unchanged: check_capabilities takes the WORST
# decision across the set and shell_exec is already DENY by default, so
# adding an ASK-default class cannot loosen anything.
#
# fs_read (#807 follow-up): self_dev_campaign reads the campaign driver file
# (driver_path.read_text) and rewrites it after each auto-merge. The AST-
# completeness check (#47) would flag read_text as undeclared; fs_write covers
# writes, so fs_read is explicitly added here for reads.
