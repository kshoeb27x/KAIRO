"""Strategy evaluation runner.

IMPORTANT: code + bars travel over the child's stdin, not argv. Windows
`CreateProcessW` caps the whole command line at 32,767 characters, and one
symbol's full year of daily bars alone already runs ~36KB base64-encoded --
over the limit on its own, before the strategy code is even added (confirmed
2026-08-24: a real SPY gauntlet run produced a 36,553-char command line and
CreateProcessW failed outright with error 206/ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE,
silently degrading every such run to an all-flat signal). stdin has no such
limit. This doesn't change the "no batching tickers through one spawn"
policy -- this sandbox exists to run *generated* untrusted strategy code,
and only tickers that survive the cheap in-process pre-filter get a real
sandboxed evaluation, one spawn each; stdin just fixes how a single
ticker's own payload gets in.
