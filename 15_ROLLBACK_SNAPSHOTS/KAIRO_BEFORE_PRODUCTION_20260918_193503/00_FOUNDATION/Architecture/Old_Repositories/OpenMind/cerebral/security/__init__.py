"""
Capability vocabulary and the orchestrator-side permission gate (ADR-0005).

The 16-class enum is the closed vocabulary every plugin declares against and
every call site checks. The gate looks up the day-1 default policy, applies
the `passive` escalation, and returns a SILENT / ASK / DENY decision. The
orchestrator decides what to do with each (ASK resolves to DENY in this slice;
the consent surface lands in #48).
