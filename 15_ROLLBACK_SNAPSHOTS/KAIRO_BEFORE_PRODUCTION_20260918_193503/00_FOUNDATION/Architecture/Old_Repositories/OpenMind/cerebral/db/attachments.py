"""Conversation attachment store -- S14 (#297).

Per-profile local file store for files dragged/uploaded into the composer.
Files are copied into ``cerebral/data/attachments/<profile_id>/<uuid>/``
and a row is written into ``conversation_attachments`` carrying the
original filename, mime, size, the stored path, and (when extractable)
the file's text contents.

No cloud upload -- everything is on disk next to the SQLite DB. The
stored_path is held alongside the conversation_turn so a future Files
plugin can act on it without a second copy.

Two-phase write so the UI feels instant:

    1. Renderer reads the file, sends ``attach_files`` with base64 bytes.
    2. Backend writes the file, runs cheap text extraction, returns an
       ``attachment_id`` + metadata (label, kind, size).
    3. Renderer renders a chip with the id pending against the next send.
    4. On ``user_text_command`` with ``attachment_ids``, Cerebral binds
       the rows to the user turn and folds extracted text into the prompt.

Extraction is best-effort and synchronous: text-like files decode to
UTF-8 (capped at ``MAX_EXTRACTED_CHARS``); PDFs attempt ``pypdf`` if
installed; images and other binaries are stored unmodified with no
extracted text (the renderer reads ``kind`` to decide chip styling, and
a future vision-capable model will receive the file via the
``stored_path``).
