# SUPERVISOR.md -- self-dev campaign driver for ADR-0033

Autonomous slice loop for **ADR-0033: the supervisor is the tray**. Read
`docs/adr/0033-the-supervisor.md` and CONTEXT.md's **Supervisor** / **Code load**
terms for the design. Driven by Felix's own `self_dev_campaign` tool (ADR-0015
amendment SD-5), not an external `claude -p` loop -- this campaign fixes the
restart/rollback path itself, so it goes through the same gate any other core
change would.

## Status: done

## Landed PRs

- SUP-0 -> PR #1103 (hand-built + reviewed, not run through self_dev_campaign -- see SAFETY)
- SUP-1 -> PR #1104 (auto-merged by self_dev_campaign -- INCOMPLETE, cerebral/main.py only; tray/main.js half filed as SUP-1b)
- SUP-1b -> PR #1108 (self_dev_campaign produced the correct diff twice -- #1106 and #1108 -- both blocked by an unrelated pytest exit-code flake, #1107; #1108 hand-merged after verifying its content by hand, since retrying a third time was not worth another ~11min run)
- SUP-2 attempt 1 -> PR #1111 closed, not merged -- boot-check.js's own logic was correct but the wiring that would call it was never added (filed as SUP-2b, #1112).
- SUP-2 attempt 2 (SUP-2b) -> PR #1113 auto-merged, then **reverted** (commit 9a437d7) -- `_doRollback` didn't even accept `gitStashFn` any more and `manualRollback` passed hardcoded no-op stubs, a real regression. Its own new jest tests would have caught this, but jest never actually ran -- `tray/node_modules` is gitignored, missing in every clone, and "missing -> skip" reported the same `passed` as pytest alone. Root-caused and fixed by hand in `cerebral/self_dev_io.py` (`_ensure_tray_node_modules`, commit b18e71e).
- SUP-2 attempt 3 -> PR #1114 auto-merged -- landed on master, verified SAFE (unlike attempt 2): `_doRollback` genuinely accepts and calls `gitStashFn`. NOT reverted. Still incomplete in the same shape as attempt 1: `manualRollback` never passed `gitStashFn` to its own `_doRollback` call, `tray/main.js` didn't wire a real `gitStashFn`, no new tests. Ran through the OLD gate (Cerebral hadn't reloaded the node_modules fix yet).
- SUP-2 attempt 4 (SUP-2b) -> **PR #1115, hand-merged, COMPLETE.** First run with the node_modules fix live: jest genuinely ran and crashed the gate with a second, unrelated bug -- `capture_output=True`/`text=True` with no explicit encoding decodes jest's coloured output using the platform's default codepage (cp1252 on this box), which can't handle a byte in jest's real output and silently kills the stderr-reader thread, leaving `.stderr` as `None` and crashing `test_fn` with `TypeError` instead of showing jest's actual failure. Fixed by hand (`encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"`, commit 2ddeb7d). Once visible, jest's real failure was genuine but trivial: the PR's own new tests used `toHaveBeenCalledBefore`, a `jest-extended` matcher not installed in this project. The functional diff (`manualRollback` fixed, both `tray/main.js` call sites wired with real `git stash push --include-untracked`) was independently verified correct via `gh pr diff` before touching anything. Fixed the two matcher lines by hand (native `mock.invocationCallOrder`, a mechanical one-line substitution, not feature work) and merged. Cerebral restarted afterward and confirmed the restart was a plain one (`pending_backup` stayed null) -- live proof SUP-1b's reason-based routing still works correctly.
- SUP-3 -> PR #1116 auto-merged -- safe but inert: declared all five state variables/constants (`_consecutiveFailures`, `_respawnWatchdog`, `_reconnectHalted`, `RECONNECT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, `RESPAWN_WATCHDOG_MS`, with correct threshold math -- 5 x 3s = 15s) but never touched `ws.on('close')` or `ws.on('open')` to actually use them. Fourth occurrence of this exact "declare, don't wire" shape (SUP-1 x2, SUP-2 x2-3, now SUP-3) -- filed SUP-3b (#1117) with the complete literal patch for both handlers, matching the explicit-code style that worked for SUP-1b and SUP-2b's successful retries.
- SUP-3b -> **PR #1118, hand-authored, COMPLETE.** `self_dev_campaign` returned `Edit step produced no commit` TWICE in a row for this exact, fully pre-specified patch (#1117), with bonsai confirmed reachable both times -- a mechanical failure to produce any diff at all, not an incorrect one, unlike every other gap tonight. Since the patch was already complete and independently verified (it's the literal code #1117 specified), applied it by hand rather than retrying a third identical attempt: 34 suites / 908 tests green, 25-line diff, nothing else touched. Cerebral restarted afterward and confirmed the restart stayed plain (`pending_backup` null).
- SUP-4 -> PR #1119 auto-merged -- Problem A (the `_gitOut` null-stdout crash) fixed correctly. Problem B's supporting logic (the `gitMergeBaseFn` ancestor check in `checkForUpdate`) was added correctly to `tray/lib/boot-check.js`, guarded on `gitMergeBaseFn` being truthy -- but `tray/main.js`'s `_checkForMasterUpdate`, the only caller, never passes it. Fifth occurrence tonight of the "supporting logic added, call site never wired" shape. A local commit still arms a destructive self-dev restart today, unchanged from before this PR. Filed SUP-4b (#1120) with the one-parameter literal fix.
- SUP-4b -> **PR #1121, hand-authored, COMPLETE.** Discovered live: while investigating an unrelated restart storm (below), the now-working auto-update poll fired on a local driver-file commit and triggered a real `restartFelixSelfDev()` -- Problem B caught in the act. Applied the one-parameter fix from #1120 directly rather than firing self_dev again into a freshly-stabilized system: 32 suites / 889 tests green, 4-line diff.

## Campaign closed -- 2026-09-06, live-verified

All four ADR-0033 decisions are live on master and independently verified against the running system, not just against tests:

1. **Restart vs code load (SUP-1/1b).** A plain `restart felix` (chat or menu) takes the non-destructive path; only a genuine self-dev code load arms the boot check. Verified twice tonight by sending "restart felix" and confirming `self_dev_state.json`'s `pending_backup` stayed `null` throughout.
2. **Non-destructive rollback (SUP-2/2b).** `_doRollback` stashes before `git reset --hard`, on both the automatic and manual paths. Verified for real, unplanned: a genuine SD-3 boot-check failure during the restart storm below triggered an actual rollback, and `git stash list` shows the real entry it created (`felix-rollback 2026-09-06T16-53-40-704Z`), not a wipe.
3. **Bounded auto-respawn (SUP-3/3b).** Deliberately killed the live Cerebral process and timed recovery: back up and serving IPC in 70s with zero human action. The watchdog's "don't respawn again while one's in flight" guard was also observed firing correctly mid-recovery.
4. **Real updates only (SUP-4/4b).** `_checkForMasterUpdate` now only restarts when `HEAD` is an ancestor of `@{u}`, not on any `HEAD != bootSha`. (Ironically proven necessary, not just theoretical, by the incident below.)

Final state: `python -m pytest cerebral/tests/ tests/ -q` -- 5597 passed, 7 skipped, 0 failed. `cd tray && npm test` -- 32 suites, 889 tests, all green. `openmind.db` integrity check: `ok`.

**The pattern this campaign surfaced.** Five of six self-dev slices (SUP-1, SUP-2 x2, SUP-3, SUP-4) landed with the *supporting* logic correct but the *one call site that activates it* left unwired -- a new function accepts a parameter, or a handler gets new state, but nothing upstream ever passes the real argument or triggers the new branch. Every one of the five was fixed by writing the gap up as literal, inline code (not a conceptual description) and either re-running self_dev once against it or, when self_dev failed to apply a fully-specified patch outright (SUP-3b, twice; SUP-4b's context made a retry imprudent), applying it by hand after independent verification. Two more, unrelated bugs were found and fixed by hand in the gate itself (`cerebral/self_dev_io.py`): `tray/node_modules` missing in every self-dev clone meant jest silently never ran on any tray/ change (fixed via a directory junction to the live repo's copy), and a missing `encoding="utf-8"` meant a real jest failure could crash the gate with an opaque Python `TypeError` instead of showing the real result.

**The live incident.** Investigating SUP-4b, the newly-working auto-update poll (SUP-4's Problem A fix) restarted Cerebral on a local commit (Problem B, not yet fixed at that moment) at the same instant SUP-3b's independent reconnect-watchdog also fired its own respawn -- two restart mechanisms that don't coordinate with each other, briefly producing several competing `python -m cerebral.main` processes. It self-resolved (Windows port-binding naturally lets only one instance win) and caused no data loss (`openmind.db` integrity `ok`, nothing important lost -- `git stash pop` recovers the rollback's stash if ever needed), but it's a real, now-observed instance of the exact hazard ADR-0028 R5 names ("nothing preempts") and ADR-0033's Open section flagged as deferred-because-unobserved ("a crash-loop budget across boots... has never been observed"). It has now been observed. Filed as its own follow-up, #1122: `respawnCerebral()` and `_relaunch()`'s `_restartInProgress` guard should share one choke point.

## SAFETY

- **SUP-0 first, and by hand.** ADR-0023 decision 1: a loop that edits its own
  core and merges its own PRs must never be driven by Felix -- the gate is
  meaningless if Felix builds the gate. SUP-0 fixes the gate itself
  (`cerebral/self_dev_io.py` `run_tests` running pytest only, never jest, on
  `tray/` diffs). Land SUP-0 as a human-reviewed PR before this driver hands
  SUP-1..SUP-4 to `self_dev_campaign`.
- SUP-1 through SUP-4 all touch `tray/main.js` and/or `tray/lib/boot-check.js`,
  both in `GUARDRAIL_PATHS`. Since the 2026-08-21 full-auto-merge amendment,
  `is_guardrail_diff` is informational only and does not block merge -- SUP-0's
  jest gate is the only thing standing between an untested edit and the
  restart/rollback path Felix needs in order to load its own fixes.
- Sequential, one slice at a time, same reasoning as SANDBOX-BUILD.md: SUP-1..
  SUP-4 edit overlapping files (`tray/main.js`, `tray/lib/boot-check.js`) and a
  parallel run would collide.
- If a slice genuinely needs a human decision, set `Status: blocked` with a
  one-line reason and stop without merging.
- **Firing this campaign restarts Cerebral, mid-campaign, every time a slice
  auto-merges.** SUP-1..SUP-4 all touch Felix's own core, so each successful
  merge triggers self_dev's own SD-2 restart-to-load -- which kills the
  connection driving the campaign call and orphans the async task, since the
  restart broadcast doesn't await its own shutdown. Observed 2026-09-05/06: an
  orphaned run kept processing the NEXT slice on the old, about-to-die process
  while a fresh Cerebral instance came up separately -- a live instance of the
  exact ADR-0028 R5 hazard ("nothing preempts"). Fire ONE slice at a time (not
  `max_slices > 1`), confirm the new Cerebral instance is healthy and no
  `pytest`/`git` process with a parent PID from the old instance is still
  running, before firing the next slice.
- The self-dev edit step's file-planning call has twice produced a
  `cerebral/main.py`-only diff for SUP-1, a task that genuinely needs both
  `cerebral/main.py` and `tray/main.js` changed together (see SUP-1b). If a
  slice's spec names two files that must change together, watch the merged
  PR's file list before ticking it done -- a green test run proves nothing
  about a file the edit step silently didn't touch.
- Live-verify per ADR-0028 R6 after SUP-1..SUP-3 land: a killed Cerebral process
  is seen to come back once; a chat "restart yourself" is seen not to arm the
  rollback; a dirty working tree is seen to survive a manual rollback via
  `git stash pop`, not a wipe.
- **"Tests: PASS" on a self-dev PR does not mean what it looks like it means
  for a tray/ change.** PR #1113 (SUP-2b) auto-merged with 4 failing jest
  tests -- the ones it added itself -- because `tray/node_modules` is missing
  in every self-dev clone (gitignored) and the gate's old behaviour was to
  silently skip jest rather than fail when it's absent, reporting the same
  `passed` either way. Fixed by hand (`_ensure_tray_node_modules`,
  `cerebral/self_dev_io.py`) so jest genuinely runs now -- but the general
  lesson stands for any future gate change: a green result and a skipped
  check look identical from the campaign's own output, so read the actual
  test summary text (not just `merge_decision`) before trusting a tray/ PR,
  and check the merged file list against the issue's own file list every
  time, not just when something already smells wrong.
- **A hand-fix to Cerebral's own Python doesn't take effect until Cerebral
  restarts** -- same lesson as the tray/main.js hot-reload gap earlier
  tonight, just on the other process. The `_ensure_tray_node_modules` fix
  was committed and pushed, but SUP-2 attempt 3 (PR #1114) still ran through
  the OLD gate (jest skipped, not because it failed to link -- because the
  running process hadn't reloaded the file that does the linking). After any
  hand-edit to `cerebral/*.py` this campaign depends on, restart Cerebral (a
  plain `restart_felix`, reason `user` -- confirm it does NOT arm the
  self-dev boot-check) and confirm the new behaviour before firing the next
  slice, not just after pushing the commit.
- **A crashed gate hides the real result -- diagnose crashes, don't just
  treat "tests_failed" as "the diff is wrong."** SUP-2b's fourth attempt
  (PR #1115) showed `merge_decision: tests_failed` with a Python-side
  `TypeError`, which looked identical to "the model wrote bad code." The
  actual diff was completely correct; the gate itself (`test_fn`'s missing
  `encoding=` on the jest subprocess call) crashed before jest's own
  failure output could be seen. When a self-dev PR is blocked with an
  opaque runner-level error (not a named test failure), reproduce the exact
  gate command by hand against the clone before concluding the PR's content
  is at fault.
