"""Trigger a self_dev_campaign run on a live Felix instance over its tray
WebSocket IPC (ws://localhost:7766) and print the JSON result.

Bypasses the chat/LLM layer entirely -- sends the same {"type": "call_tool"}
message the tray sends for a direct tool invocation (main.py's
_dispatch_tray_call_tool / issue #238), so there's no dependency on a model
noticing or correctly invoking the tool. Applies the same ACL/consent gate
tray calls always go through.

NOTE (2026-09-08): trigger()'s result-matching below filters incoming
tool_result messages by tool NAME only ("self_dev_campaign"), not by a
per-request id -- the tray IPC broadcasts tool_result to every connected
client, not just the requester. Two concurrent trigger_campaign.py runs
used to each pick up whichever campaign's result arrived first, sometimes
the WRONG one (confirmed live: both scripts printed the same, first-to-
finish campaign's output). This is now safe because SelfDevPlugin._campaign
(plugins/self_dev.py) refuses a second concurrent campaign outright -- there
can never be two self_dev_campaign tool_results in flight to confuse. Don't
run two of these in parallel expecting them to queue; the second call
returns is_error=True immediately instead.

Usage:
    python scripts/trigger_campaign.py <driver_file> [max_slices]

Exit code 0 with the result JSON on stdout; non-zero with a message on
stderr on connection failure or timeout. A campaign result of status
"blocked" or "max_slices_reached" is still exit 0 -- that's the caller's
job to interpret, not this script's.
