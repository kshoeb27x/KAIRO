# OpenMind — Job-Application Pipeline (autonomous campaign)

Driver for `scripts/run-jobs.ps1`. Read `CONTEXT.md` ("Job-application pipeline"
glossary), `docs/adr/0009-job-application-automation.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` first,
then this file. The locked design lives in those docs; each issue body = that
slice's detail.

---

## Next slice — start here

**Job boards v2 campaign** (grilled 2026-07-24). Generalized board sourcing:
paste any job-site URL, Felix classifies it (Greenhouse/Lever JSON APIs, JobSpy
big-board search, generic scrape fallback) — plus a duplicate-application
guard. 4 slices, one PR each, auto-merged to master strictly top-down —
successive slices build on the same files (`plugins/job_search.py`, its SQLite
tables, the Job Search panel), so they MUST land sequentially. After landing a
slice, **update this block**: tick the queue entry, set the next unticked
entry's `#N` + `Model:` as the active slice here, and set `Status:` (`ready`
while unticked queue entries remain; `done` when the queue is complete).

Active slice: none

Model: sonnet
Status: done

(`Model:`/`Status:` are read directly by `scripts/run-jobs.ps1`. Allowed:
haiku | sonnet | opus | fable — prefer haiku/sonnet, this is meant to run on an
efficient model. `Status: ready` = run the active slice; `blocked` = needs a
human; `done` = stop. Stop gracefully any time with `scripts/stop-jobs.ps1`.)

## SAFETY — read before every slice

This campaign builds code that will one day drive **real job applications**. The
autonomous loop must NEVER perform a real application. Hard rules:

- **Build + unit-test against FAKES only.** Reuse the browser harness's
  `FakeDriver` seam; stub the LLM/embeddings; use saved HTML/PDF fixtures. NO
  live network, NO real ATS, NO real submission, NO real account creation, NO
  real credentials, NO real inbox reads, NO real logins seeded.
- **Live verification is a HUMAN step.** For any slice whose real behaviour can
  only be checked live (S4 real Greenhouse/Lever run, S6 real account creation),
  append a checklist item to `docs/jobs-live-verify.md` — do NOT perform it.
- **Never** run `plugins/discord_user.py` or any self-bot path (ADR-0006
  real-account-ban risk). No paid APIs, no real messages/calls.
- If a slice genuinely cannot be completed without a human (a real login, a live
  ATS), set `Status: blocked` with a one-line reason and stop.
