// Windows, writing a binary WAV to stdout corrupts it via text-mode `\n` →
// `\r\n` translation, which shifts every sample and plays back as static. File
// I/O is binary-safe on all platforms, so both backends route through these.

/// the pid + a monotonic counter; avoids a runtime dependency on `tempfile`.
