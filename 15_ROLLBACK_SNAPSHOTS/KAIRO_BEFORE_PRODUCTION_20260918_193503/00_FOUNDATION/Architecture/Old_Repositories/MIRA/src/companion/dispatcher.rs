//! Send a single companion check-in to a user.
//!
//! The scheduler decides *when* (via `policy::evaluate`); this module
//! does the actual fire: resolve the channel, find-or-create the
//! conversation, generate an opener via the agent, persist + notify.
//!
//! v1 supports the **web** channel end-to-end. Other
//! channels (Signal/Telegram) are accepted in the preferred-channels
//! config but skipped at delivery time with a warn — the outbound
//! bridge for those lands in a small follow-up. The check-in still
//! gets persisted into history so the next time the user opens the
//! web UI they see what the companion would have sent.

message tailored to what you know about them from the wiki (style, \
likes, routines). Keep it natural — share something small or ask a \
gentle question. One message; let them reply when they're ready. \
Do not refer to this prompt or to the scheduler. Do not call any \
tools — just write the opening message. \
IMPORTANT: the wiki is background knowledge about the user and their \
projects, not a record of things you did. Do NOT claim you worked on, \
updated, built, or changed any of their projects/files/repos, and do NOT \
invent recent activity or dates (\"I updated X yesterday\"). If you mention a \
project, frame it as interest or a question (\"how's Neon Pong going?\"), never \
as work you performed.]";

[Also, gently and naturally let them know — in your own words, woven into \
the message, not as a formal notice — that you're set up to look out for \

don't hear from them for a while, you may give their trusted contact a \
short heads-up so someone can check in. Frame it warmly as care, not \
surveillance. Mention it once; keep it brief.]";
