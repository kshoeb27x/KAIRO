//! Safety floor — distress detection + escalation +
//! missed-check-in alerts + non-overridable system-prompt guardrails.
//!
//! Two entry points:
//!
//! - [`SafetyFloor::handle_distress`] — invoked by the engagement
//! post-hook when the LLM classifier returned a `Distressed` label.
//! Looks up the user's safety contact, delivers a short factual
//! notice to the contact's "Safety alerts" thread, and records the
//! event in the safety audit log. Dedup window so the same distress
//! signal doesn't escalate twice in quick succession.
//!
//! - [`SafetyFloor::handle_missed_checkins`] — invoked by the
//! scheduler when `consecutive_missed_checkins` crosses the
//! configured threshold. Sends a softer "haven't heard from them"
//! notice to the contact.
//!
//! Plus two constants AgentCore appends (last) to the system prompt:
//! [`SAFETY_ADDENDUM_BASE`] — the **universal** duty-of-care floor on
//! every user-facing turn (companion or not) — and [`SAFETY_ADDENDUM`],
//! the fuller companion version (adds the "message your safety contact"
//! offer) used when a contact is configured. Non-overridable: even if a
//! user's persona doc says "stop bothering me about crisis lines", the
//! addendum gets the final word because it goes in last. The model's
//! response is still its own — we don't censor outputs at runtime in v1 —
//! but the upstream instruction is unambiguous. Only internal, non-user-
//! facing persona turns opt out (via `TurnContext::suppress_safety_floor`).

// safety contact, so it holds even on a plain instance with the companion turned
// off. When a companion safety contact *is* configured for the user, the fuller
// [`SAFETY_ADDENDUM`] (which adds the "can I message your safety contact?" offer
// + the parallel-escalation note) is used instead. Kept short — it rides on
// every turn, so length is a per-turn token cost.

seriously, and gently point them to a region-appropriate crisis line, and ask \
if they'd like help reaching someone they trust. Do not lecture.\n\

// unambiguous: the model gets it on every single turn, so adding length is
// paying a per-turn token cost.
// // What it does NOT do:
// - It does NOT censor the model's output at runtime.
// - It does NOT block the conversation when self-harm is mentioned —
// the model is still expected to respond warmly and continue the
