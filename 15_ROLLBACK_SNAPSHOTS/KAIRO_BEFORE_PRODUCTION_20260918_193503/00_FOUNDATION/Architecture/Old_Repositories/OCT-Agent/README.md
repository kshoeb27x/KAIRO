> The AI agent that never forgets — and works with all its arms at once. Built by [Awareness](https://awareness.market).

OCT is an **AI agent platform** with **long-term memory**, **CLI + desktop + messaging workflows**, **MCP tools and skills**, **automation**, and **OpenClaw-compatible migration**.

**OCT** is named after the octopus — a creature with extraordinary memory and eight arms that act in parallel. That's exactly what OCT does: it remembers everything across your conversations, and coordinates multiple agents working simultaneously on complex tasks.

Powered by **Awareness Memory**, which achieves **95.6% Recall@5 on [LongMemEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)** (ICLR 2025) — the industry benchmark for long-term conversational memory. Built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (247K+ stars), the open-source AI agent framework.

## Quick Navigation

- **Quick Install**: Desktop app or CLI in under a minute
- **Getting Started**: First memory-enabled chat in 3 minutes
- **CLI vs Messaging**: Choose terminal mode or channel mode (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord)
- **MCP Tools & Skills**: Connect tool calls, workflows, and reusable skills
- **Migrating from OpenClaw**: Keep your agent workflow and add memory
- **Community**: Discord support and release updates

---

## Why OCT?

The octopus is nature's memory champion. Each arm has its own intelligence — they can act independently or in concert. OCT is built around the same idea:

| Octopus | OCT Agent |
|---------|-----------|
| Remembers across long periods | Persistent memory across all conversations |
| 8 arms working in parallel | Multiple agents collaborating simultaneously |
| Adapts to any environment | Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux — talk via Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack |
| No central bottleneck | Each agent has its own memory + context |

---

## What Makes OCT Different

| | OCT Agent | Other agents |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | 95.6% R@5 on LongMemEval (ICLR 2025) | No persistent memory, or basic summarization |
| **Multi-agent** | Parallel agents with shared memory pool | Single agent only |
| **Install** | One download, double-click — no terminal | Requires Node, Python, config files |
| **Channels** | Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, Slack, Signal, Discord | CLI only |
| **Benchmark** | Hybrid BM25+Vector, 0 LLM calls | LLM-dependent recall |

---

## Features

- **🧠 Persistent Memory** — Knowledge cards, perception signals (contradiction, pattern, resonance), and cross-session recall. Your AI remembers who you are, what you decided, and what you care about.
- **🐙 Multi-Agent Collaboration** — Spawn isolated agents for parallel workstreams. Each arm works independently; all arms share the same long-term memory.
- **⚡ One-Click Install** — Download, double-click, done. No terminal, no Node.js, no Git required.
- **📱 Talk from Anywhere** — Connect Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, Slack, Signal, or Discord. Your agent works while you're away.
- **🔍 Memory Benchmark Leader** — 95.6% Recall@5 on LongMemEval. Zero LLM calls. Hybrid BM25+Vector search.
- **🌍 Cross-Platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux. One binary, three platforms.
- **🔄 Auto Upgrade** — Follows OpenClaw releases automatically. No manual updates.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Desktop App (Recommended)

Download from [awareness.market](https://awareness.market/) or [Releases](https://github.com/edwin-hao-ai/OCT-Agent/releases):

| Platform | Download |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | `OCT.dmg` |
| **Windows** | `OCT-Agent.Setup.exe` |
| **Linux** | `OCT.AppImage` |

Double-click to install. No terminal required.

### Option 2: CLI (Advanced)

```bash
npx @awareness.market/claw
```

---

## Getting Started (3 Minutes)

1. Install OCT Desktop or run the CLI installer.
2. Send your first message in chat.
3. Ask a follow-up question that depends on prior context.
4. Verify that memory recall is used automatically.

This is the fastest way to validate OCT as an **AI agent with persistent memory** rather than a stateless assistant.

---

## CLI vs Messaging Channels

OCT supports both **CLI workflows** and **messaging workflows**.

- **CLI mode**: Best for developers, scripts, and terminal-first automation.
- **Messaging mode**: Best for teams and non-technical users via Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, Slack, Signal, and Discord.

Use CLI when you need deterministic command/control. Use messaging when you need always-on agent access from mobile and team chat.

---

## MCP Tools and Skills

OCT works with **MCP tools** and reusable **skills** so agents can call external capabilities safely and repeatedly.

- Use MCP tools for structured integrations and tool-calling workflows.
- Use skills for repeatable playbooks and team-level automation.
- Combine memory + tools + skills to reduce repeated prompt engineering.

---

## Migrating from OpenClaw

Already using OpenClaw? OCT is designed for **OpenClaw-compatible migration**.

- OCT wraps OpenClaw instead of forking/replacing it.
- Keep existing agent workflows and channels.
- Add long-term memory and desktop UX incrementally.

Migration path: install OCT, validate first chat, then move your daily workflow gradually.

## How Memory Works

Every conversation feeds OCT's memory loop:

```
You talk to OCT
      ↓
OCT captures knowledge cards
  (decisions, preferences, facts, contradictions)
      ↓
Awareness Memory indexes them
  (BM25 + Vector hybrid, 0 LLM calls)
      ↓
Next conversation: OCT recalls relevant context
  before you even ask
      ↓
Your AI gets smarter with every session
```

Memory types OCT tracks:
- **Knowledge cards** — facts, decisions, preferences you've stated
- **Perception signals** — contradictions, recurring patterns, strong resonance moments
- **Temporal reasoning** — what you knew when, how your views changed over time
- **Cross-session continuity** — picks up exactly where you left off

---

## Architecture

```
OCT Agent (this project)
  └── wraps OpenClaw (open-source AI agent, 247K+ stars)
       └── pre-configured with Awareness Memory plugin
            └── hybrid search (BM25 + Vector, Hybrid RRF)
            └── perception signals (contradiction, pattern, resonance)
            └── cross-device sync via Awareness cloud
```

---

## Development

```bash
# CLI
cd packages/cli && npm start

# Desktop
cd packages/desktop && npm run dev
