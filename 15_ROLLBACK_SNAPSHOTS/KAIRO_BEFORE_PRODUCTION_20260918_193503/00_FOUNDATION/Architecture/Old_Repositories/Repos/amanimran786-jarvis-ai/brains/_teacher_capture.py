"""Shared cloud->local teacher capture lane.

When `JARVIS_TEACHER_CAPTURE=1` is set, successful cloud answers from the
strong/deep tiers are recorded as JSONL teacher examples for fine-tuning the
local open-source model. This module is the single capture surface used by
both `provider_priority` (one-shot lane) and `model_router` (streaming lane)
so we never double-implement the gate.

Best-effort by design: any failure here is logged and swallowed so user-facing
responses are never affected by the capture lane.
