> Local-first: Ollama handles routing; only call cloud APIs when truly needed.

## Context
Jarvis is a Python macOS AI runtime. Main entry: `main.py`. Core modules in `harness/`.
Routing layers: `router.py` → `orchestrator.py` → `operative.py` → `execution_engine.py`.
Model routing: `model_router.py`. UI: `ui.py` (PyQt6). Voice: `voice.py`.
See `AI_AGENTS_COORDINATION.md` for full ownership map and project state.

Run `python -m pytest tests/ -x -q` to verify your work before committing.

## Your tasks (priority order)

### ✅ CODEX-1: GLM 5.2 eval findings (HIGH — blocks Claude)
Completed: published `CODEX_GLM_EVAL.md`; readiness tests pass, but five live query attempts were subscription-blocked, so GLM 5.2 must not become the default.
This task is **blocking** a Claude work item. Complete it first.

- Read `RECOMMENDED_MODELS.md` and `model_router.py` to understand the current GLM routing setup
- Read `evals.json` and `logs/self_eval.jsonl` to understand current eval scores by model
- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_glm52_readiness.py -v` and report pass/fail
- Evaluate GLM 5.2 on 5 representative Jarvis queries (code, planning, QA, voice command, tool routing)
- Write findings to: `GEMINI_GLM_EVAL.md` (or `CODEX_GLM_EVAL.md`)
- Decision: should `model_router.py` be updated to set GLM 5.2 as a default? State yes/no with evidence.
- Commit: `[CODEX] docs(eval): GLM 5.2 routing readiness findings`

### ✅ CODEX-2: Voice TTS per operative step (HIGH)
Completed: added opt-in operative step announcements through the existing macOS `say` backend, with non-fatal failure logging and regression coverage.
- File: `harness/tts.py` (create)
- When Jarvis completes a task step in `operative.py`, speak it aloud using macOS `say` command
- Add config flag: `VOICE_ENABLED` (bool, default False) to `config.py`
- Wire into `operative.py`'s `on_progress` callback — only speak if `VOICE_ENABLED=True`
- Fallback: if TTS fails, log via `logging.exception()` and continue — never crash Jarvis
- The existing TTS path lives in `voice.py` — check it before reinventing (reuse if possible)
- Test: `tests/test_voice_tts_regression.py` already exists — extend it, don't break it
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(tts): voice utterance per operative step`

### ✅ CODEX-3: PyQt6 system tray panel (HIGH)
Completed: added a standalone PyQt6 tray with live green/yellow/red status, Jarvis launch, latest-task details, and quit actions.
- File: `ui/tray.py` (create, or extend `ui.py` if that's cleaner — check first)
- A minimal macOS system tray icon showing Jarvis status
- Menu items: "Open Jarvis", "Last task status", "Quit"
- Status indicator: green (idle), yellow (running task), red (error)
- Reads `ORCHESTRATOR_STATUS.json` every 5s to update status
- Launch with: `python ui/tray.py &`
- PyQt6 is already a dependency — check `requirements.txt` before adding anything
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(ui): PyQt6 system tray status panel`

### ✅ CODEX-5: Wire the autonomous loop scheduler (HIGH)

Completed: connected durable handoffs to isolated local `task_runtime` execution,
polling, approval states, timeout cancellation, completion harvesting, and
classified retry failures. Retired three false active sessions and blocked
untyped legacy rows from autonomous execution.

The loop harness is built (`orchestrator_loop.py`, `LAUNCH_QUEUE.json`). What's missing is the
companion script that actually fires Cowork sessions and harvests completions.

Build `harness/cowork_launcher.py`:
- Read `LAUNCH_QUEUE.json`; for each entry with `status == "pending"`:
  - Append to `PENDING_SESSIONS.json` with the full prompt and metadata
  - Mark the entry `"handoff_ready"` and write back to `LAUNCH_QUEUE.json`
- Call `orchestrator_loop.run_loop()` to harvest completions and enqueue new work
- Script must be idempotent — safe to call every 5 minutes even when nothing is pending

Wire as a launchd job on macOS:
- Write `scripts/com.jarvis.loop.plist` (canonical plist for the repo)
- Deploy to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.loop.plist` for activation
- ProgramArguments: `/usr/bin/python3 /Users/truthseeker/jarvis-ai/harness/cowork_launcher.py`
- Interval: 300 seconds
- Log stdout → `logs/launchd.log`, stderr → `logs/launchd_error.log`
- Create `LAUNCHD_SETUP.md` with install/uninstall instructions:
  - Install: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.loop.plist`
  - Uninstall: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jarvis.loop.plist`

Commit: `[CODEX] feat(harness): cowork_launcher + launchd plist for 5-min loop`

Current truth: `handoff_ready` records are submitted through local `task_runtime`
with isolated worktrees. The scheduler persists runtime correlation, polls across
invocations, and only hands successful terminal work to the completion verifier.

### CODEX-6: /history command with Rich CLI (MEDIUM) ✅

Build the `/history` command and upgrade the REPL's visual chrome using the `rich` library.

`/history` command (in `main.py` or `harness/repl.py`):
- Default: last 10 turns; accept optional `N` argument (`/history 20`)
- Read turns from `usage_log.jsonl`
- Each turn: timestamp (dim), role label (bold cyan for user / bold green for assistant), content truncated to 120 chars
- Use `rich.table.Table` or `rich.panel.Panel` for layout

REPL prompt upgrades:
- Color the `Jarvis>` prompt (bold magenta)
- Show budget status (tokens used / limit) in the right margin using `rich.live` or prompt suffix
- Color-code response types: model output (white), tool calls (cyan), errors (red), memory ops (dim)
- Add a spinner (`rich.progress` or `rich.status`) during long operations — wire into `operative.py`'s streaming callback

Add `rich` to `requirements.txt` if not already present (check first).
If not installed in the environment: `pip install rich`

Commit: `[CODEX] feat(cli): /history command + Rich REPL chrome`

### CODEX-7: Plugin system foundation (MEDIUM) ✅

Build a plugin loader in `harness/plugin_loader.py`. Check `plugins/` for any existing files first
before writing anything — don't clobber.

`harness/plugin_loader.py`:
- `scan_plugins(plugins_dir: str) -> list[ModuleType]` — imports every `*.py` in `plugins/`
- `load_all(router) -> int` — calls `plugin.register(router)` on each; returns count loaded
- Failures in one plugin must not abort the others — catch, log, continue
- Log each loaded plugin at INFO level

Plugin contract:
- Each plugin exports `register(router)` where `router` is the Jarvis command router
- `register` calls `router.add_command(name, handler, help_text)`

Example plugin — `plugins/echo_plugin.py`:
- Adds `/echo <text>` command
- Returns the input text prefixed with `Echo: `
- Demonstrates minimal register(router) contract with no external dependencies

Wire into `main.py` startup — call `plugin_loader.load_all(router)` before the REPL loop.

Commit: `[CODEX] feat(plugins): plugin_loader + weather example plugin`

### CODEX-8: Write task contracts for all 27 blocked tasks (HIGH)

The typed task contract system is live: `harness/task_contract.py` defines `TaskContract`,
`validate_contract`, `load_contracts`, `save_contracts`, `contract_for_task`. Contracts live
in `TASK_CONTRACTS.json` (5 samples already written). The orchestrator gate in
`orchestrator_loop.py` unblocks a legacy task only when a valid contract covers it.

- Read `WORK_QUEUE.json` — every entry with `status == "blocked"` and
  `blocked_reason == "autonomous execution requires an explicit typed task contract"`
- Skip the 5 tasks that already have a `contract_id` field — their contracts exist
- For each remaining task, write a `TaskContract` (see `harness/task_contract.py` for the
  schema: task_id, task_type, description, inputs, outputs, side_effects,
  requires_capabilities, reversible, requires_approval, entry_point, preconditions,
  postconditions)
- Use a unique slug task_id like `<session_name>-<short-slug>` (session_name alone is NOT
  unique) and stamp the matching WORK_QUEUE entry with `"contract_id": "<that slug>"`
- Anything touching vault/, config defaults, git push, or messaging gets
  `requires_approval: true` plus non-empty preconditions
- Append all contracts to `TASK_CONTRACTS.json` (keep it a JSON list, sorted by task_id —
  or just use `save_contracts()` which sorts for you)
- Verify: `python3 -c "from harness.task_contract import load_contracts, validate_contract; cs = load_contracts(); errs = {k: validate_contract(c)[1] for k, c in cs.items() if not validate_contract(c)[0]}; print(len(cs), 'contracts'); assert not errs, errs"`
- Run `python -m pytest tests/test_task_contract.py -q` — must stay green
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(contracts): task contracts for all blocked WORK_QUEUE entries`

### CODEX-9: /contracts CLI command (MEDIUM)

Add a `/contracts` command to the REPL (in `main.py` or `harness/repl.py` — check where
`/history` from CODEX-6 landed and follow that pattern).

- `/contracts` — list all contracts in `TASK_CONTRACTS.json`: task_id, task_type,
  requires_approval, and validation status (VALID / error count)
- `/contracts <task_id>` — show full contract details (inputs, outputs, side_effects,
  capabilities, pre/postconditions)
- `/contracts validate` — run `validate_contract()` on every contract and report all errors
- Use `rich.table.Table` for output (rich is already installed; see the CODEX-6 chrome)
- Import from `harness.task_contract`: `load_contracts`, `validate_contract`
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(cli): /contracts command for task contract management`

### CODEX-10: Capability discovery (MEDIUM)

Build `harness/capability_checker.py` so the orchestrator can verify a contract's
`requires_capabilities` before dispatch.

- `check_capability(cap: Capability) -> bool` for each member of
  `harness.task_contract.Capability`:
  - OLLAMA: GET `http://localhost:11434/api/tags` with 3s timeout
  - FILESYSTEM: working_directory is readable and writable (`os.access`)
  - INTERNET: HEAD `https://api.openai.com` with 3s timeout
  - GIT: `subprocess.run(["git", "--version"], shell=False, timeout=5)`
  - PYTHON: `subprocess.run(["python3", "--version"], shell=False, timeout=5)`
  - VOICE: `sounddevice.query_devices()` succeeds (import inside the function; missing
    module = False, never a crash)
  - CALENDAR / IMESSAGE / SCREEN: return False with a logged "not yet probeable" note
- `check_contract_capabilities(contract: TaskContract) -> dict[str, bool]` — capability
  name → available
- Wire into `orchestrator_loop.py` right after the contract-validation gate: call it and
  `_log_master()` any missing capabilities (log-only for now, do not block)
- All subprocess calls: list args, `shell=False`, explicit timeout
- Tests in `tests/test_capability_checker.py` — mock subprocess/HTTP, no real network
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(harness): capability_checker for pre-execution validation`

### CODEX-11: Contract approval workflow (LOW)

The gate half already exists: `orchestrator_loop.py` sends `requires_approval=True` tasks
to `status = "awaiting_approval"` unless `harness.task_contract.approval_logged(task_id)`
finds a record in `approved_tasks.json`. Build the human half.

- `approved_tasks.json` (repo root): JSON list of
  `{"task_id": ..., "approved_at": <ISO-8601 UTC>, "approved_by": <user>}`
- `/approve <task_id>` REPL command — validates the task_id exists in
  `TASK_CONTRACTS.json` (via `contract_for_task`), then appends an approval record
  (atomic write, dedupe on task_id)
- `/pending-approval` REPL command — lists WORK_QUEUE entries with
  `status == "awaiting_approval"` plus contracted tasks with `requires_approval=True`
  and no approval record
- Add `approved_tasks.json` handling tests to `tests/test_task_contract.py` or a new
  `tests/test_approval_workflow.py`
- Commit: `[CODEX] feat(contracts): human approval workflow for sensitive tasks`
