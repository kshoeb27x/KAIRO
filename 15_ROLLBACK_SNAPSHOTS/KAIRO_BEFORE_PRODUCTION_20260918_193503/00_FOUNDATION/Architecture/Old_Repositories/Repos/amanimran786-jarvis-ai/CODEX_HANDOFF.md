# Jarvis Beta Test Handoff — 2026-04-25

## What was done this session

### Bugs fixed
1. **`Say:` prefix leaked into message body** — `_sanitize_message_body` now strips leading `Say: ` before storing draft.
2. **`send an iMessage to +NUMBER` not parsed** — compose regex extended to include `imessage`/`i message` keyword.
3. **Wrong contact sent without showing number** — draft confirmation now shows resolved phone number when unambiguous (`_eager_resolve_contact` + `_message_confirmation_prompt` update).
4. **Time query going to LLM** — `_dispatch_single_intent` now runs on single queries too (not just multi-intent), instant `datetime.now()` response.
5. **Web search opening Chrome instead of returning results** — fast-path added before the browser block in `route_stream`; `"search the web for"` / `"search google for"` removed from browser triggers.
6. **`qwen3.6:35b-a3b` model tag mismatch** — fixed in `config.py` to `qwen3.6:35b` (actual Ollama tag).
7. **`mem0ai` not installed** — installed in venv; confirmed `mem0_layer.status()` was returning false due to missing package.

### New features added
- **`messages_thread.py`** — lightweight conversation thread tracker. Records sent messages and incoming relays. Persists to `~/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/message_threads.json`.
- **"X replied: [message]" flow** — Jarvis records the incoming message, generates a contextual draft reply using conversation history, and stages it for confirm-send.
- **"reply to X" flow** — shows conversation history with that contact and asks what to say.
- Both flows wire into the existing confirm-send confirmation gate.

## What still needs testing/fixing

### Actively in-progress (tests running when handed off)
- Web search returns results vs opening browser — test result pending (model was loading)
- Incoming message relay ("Farhan replied: ...") — test result pending (requests queued behind model)

### Known issues not yet addressed
- **Audio hardware error** (`PaMacCore AUHAL "what" error`) — repeated in logs, microphone is erroring during wake-word polling. This causes STT polling errors but doesn't crash the app. Needs investigation in `voice.py`.
- **5 repeated `tool_execution` failures** in cost_policy tracking — these are from the pre-fix crashes. Will clear after fresh conversations succeed.
- **mem0 cross-session memory** — installed but not yet verified working end-to-end with Qdrant embeddings.
- **iMessage read history** — requires Full Disk Access for `chat.db`. Current workaround: Jarvis-maintained thread log. User needs to grant FDA to Terminal in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access for full history read.

## Current Jarvis state
- Running: `./venv/bin/python main.py --no-ui` on port 8765
- Token: check `~/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/.jarvis_runtime.json`
- Mode: open-source (all local, $0 cost)
- Active models: `qwen3.6:35b` (general), `deepseek-r1:14b` (reasoning), `gemma4:e4b` (fast/simple)

## How to continue testing

```bash
cd ~/jarvis-ai
TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('/Users/truthseeker/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/.jarvis_runtime.json'))['token'])")

# Helper
chat() { curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/chat -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"message\": $(python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.dumps(sys.argv[1]))" "$1")}" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('['+d.get('model','?')+']: '+d.get('response',''))"; }

# Test each feature
chat "What time is it?"
chat "Search the web for latest AI news"
chat "What is the capital of France?"
chat "Farhan replied: yo bro that intro message was wild"
chat "cancel message"   # if draft is pending
chat "reply to Farhan"
```

## Next enhancements to build
1. **Email read + reply** — `google_services.get_unread_emails()` works, needs compose flow similar to iMessage
2. **Proactive notifications** — background watcher that pings on calendar events, emails, etc.
3. **Voice wake-word audio hardware fix** — silence the PaMacCore AUHAL errors
4. **iMessage FDA grant** — add instruction/prompt for user to grant Full Disk Access so Jarvis can read `chat.db` natively
5. **Weather with location** — `tools.get_weather()` may need a location parameter

## Codex app addendum — 2026-04-25 01:10 PT

Additional fixes applied after the initial handoff:
- `messages_thread.py` now aliases contact-name and resolved-address keys so sent messages and relayed incoming replies land in the same Jarvis-maintained thread.
- `reply to <contact>` now sets the pending recipient when history exists, so the next user utterance becomes a draft instead of falling into general chat.
- Incoming relay detection is narrower: explicit `replied/texted/messaged/wrote/responded: ...` or `said to reply ...` only. Plain prose like `Aman said write a SQL query` stays normal chat.
- Generated reply drafts now pass through unsafe-message screening and eager contact resolution before confirm-send.
- Added isolated temp-file tests for message thread storage; no test writes to the real Application Support message thread file.

Verified after addendum:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_messages_thread.py -q
python3 -m pytest tests/test_message_intent_parsing.py -q
python3 -m pytest tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py -q -k 'test_message_multi_turn_collects_recipient_then_body or test_time_query_bypasses_pending_message_draft or test_search_query_bypasses_pending_message_draft or test_general_question_bypasses_pending_message_draft or test_reply_to_thread_sets_pending_recipient_for_next_body or test_plain_said_prompt_does_not_become_incoming_message_relay or test_ambiguous_contact_option_selection_reconfirms_same_body_and_sends_to_resolved_contact'

```

## Claude Code parallel track — 2026-04-25

**Taking ownership of (do not touch):**
1. `briefing.py` — morning/on-demand status briefing (weather + calendar + unread email + memory summary)
2. `router.py` lines for `email_compose` flow — send email via Google, parallel to iMessage flow
3. `tools.py` — `web_search` summarization pass using gemma4:e4b (no LLM timeout risk)
4. `google_services.py` — `send_email()` wiring + `get_unread_emails()` improvements

**Leave for Codex:**
- `voice.py`, `messages.py`, `messages_thread.py`, `mem0_layer.py`, `local_runtime/`
- Any STT/TTS/audio fixes
- iMessage FDA flow

## Codex parallel track — 2026-04-25 18:05 PT

Applied and verified:
- Weather now accepts requested locations: `tools.get_weather(location="")`; router fast-path and orchestrator weather pass parsed `location/city/place`.
- Timer fast-path now accepts `set a 5 minute timer`, not only `set a timer for 5 minutes`.
- Pending email drafts now accept bare `cancel`, `stop`, `nevermind`, and `no`; these clear the draft and never call `send_email`.
- Email compose now accepts conservative spoken forms: `write an email to ... saying ...`, `draft an email for ... saying ...`, and `send ... an email saying ...`.
- Google OAuth files moved out of repo/app bundle path: `google_services.py` uses `~/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/{credentials.json,token.json}` and migrates legacy repo-root files if needed.
- `Jarvis.spec` excludes `.env`, `credentials.json`, and `token.json` from bundled datas.
- Normal voice wake-word mic selection skips meeting/virtual devices such as `Microsoft Teams Audio`, `ZoomAudio`, `BlackHole`, `Loopback`, and aggregate/multi-output devices. Smart Listen keeps its separate meeting-audio policy.
- Voice regression tests now point `.jarvis_voice.log` at a temp path so tests do not pollute production Application Support logs.

```

Packaged app verification on side port 8774 passed:
- `/status` online, open-source, local available.
- `write an email to beta@example.com saying Ship it` stages a Gmail draft.
- `cancel` cancels the draft.
- `set a 5 minute timer` returns `Timer set for 5 minutes.`
- `what is the weather in San Jose today?` returns San Jose weather.
- `find /Users/truthseeker/Applications/Jarvis.app -name token.json -o -name credentials.json -o -name .env` returned no bundled secrets.
- Latest side run selected `MacBook Pro Microphone` without AUHAL noise. Earlier side run reproduced `PaMacCore (AUHAL)` errors before recovering, so CoreAudio/PyAudio instability is improved by filtering virtual devices but not proven fully eliminated.

Current live runtime:
- Claude/source runtime is still on `127.0.0.1:8765` as `/Users/truthseeker/jarvis-ai/venv/bin/python main.py --no-ui`.
- Codex side-port packaged verifier on `8774` was stopped after verification.

## Codex / Claude sync — 2026-04-26 16:57 PDT

Observed Claude lane:
- Active pytest jobs are running against `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py`, including full regression tails and targeted message/caption cases.
- Dirty Claude-active files include `router.py`, `messages.py`, `jarvis_agents.py`, `ui.py`, `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py`, and vault/wiki outputs.
- Codex should not edit those files while Claude is iterating unless explicitly coordinating a merge.

Codex lane:
- `local_runtime/local_beta.py`: made beta status resilient to corrupt `beta_*.json` artifacts and valid run errors such as `"error": "timeout"`.
- `tests/test_local_beta_runtime.py`: added focused coverage for corrupt latest run, corrupt older run, no readable runs, API status payload, and latest readable run error.
- `jarvis_health.py`: made `check_all()` degrade timed-out checks instead of letting one checker stall/break health status.
- `tests/test_jarvis_health.py`: fixed checker patching so unit tests do not hit real Google/mem0 services and added timeout coverage.

Verification:
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_local_beta_runtime tests.test_jarvis_health tests.test_mem0_layer tests.test_local_stt_runtime tests.test_local_tts_runtime -v
git diff --check local_runtime/local_beta.py tests/test_local_beta_runtime.py jarvis_health.py tests/test_jarvis_health.py
./venv/bin/python -c 'from local_runtime import local_beta; import json; print(json.dumps(local_beta.status(), indent=2)[:2000])'
```

Live status note:
- Current real beta status shows 56 readable runs and latest error `"timeout"` from `beta_safe_subprocess_20260426_220157_engineering.json`.
- This is now surfaced in `local_beta.status()` instead of appearing as a clean 0/0 run.

## Claude Code sync — 2026-04-26 (active session)

### Current Claude lane status

**Agents running in background (worktrees — do not touch these files):**
- `agent-a0d8c26ca14328818`: Fixing 9 pre-existing test failures in `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py` — meeting fast-path tests + message state tests. Owns: `router.py` (meeting routes), `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py`
- `agent-a5b3ee68f2308ce18`: Briefing synthesis polish — `jarvis_agents.py` task formatting, vault silence, model pre-warm. Owns: `jarvis_agents.py`, `briefing.py`

**Already merged to main (Agent A):**
- `messages.py`: Added `read_recent_thread(contact, last_n)` — copies chat.db to /tmp snapshot, falls back to thread store
- `router.py`: Added `_parse_message_read_query()` + fast-path for "any new messages from X", "did X reply?" → no LLM timeout
- `tests/`: Added `InboxReadFastPathTests` (2 tests, passing)

### Claude owns going forward
- `router.py` — intent routing, fast-paths, email/message compose flows
- `jarvis_agents.py` — briefing, parallel agents, synthesis
- `briefing.py` — greeting + status briefing
- `google_services.py` — Gmail/Calendar API wrappers
- `tools.py` — system tools, web search
- Test regression coverage for all routing logic

### Codex owns — Claude will not touch
- `voice.py`, `local_runtime/`, `local_tts.py`, `local_stt.py`
- `messages.py` send/compose/relay core (Claude added read_recent_thread only)
- `messages_thread.py`
- `mem0_layer.py`
- `jarvis_health.py`
- `Jarvis.spec`, packaging, bundle

### Wave 2 — MERGED to main (commit b1dea6d, 2026-04-26)
All four sprint agents completed and merged. 388 tests passing, 0 failing.

Done:
1. ✅ **Email urgency agent** — `_agent_email_urgent()` in jarvis_agents.py, runs every briefing
2. ✅ **Context-aware reply suggestions** — `_suggest_reply_from_context()` in router.py
3. ✅ **Web search summarization** — `_summarise_for_voice()` in tools.py
4. ✅ **Calendar meeting prep fast-path** — `_is_meeting_prep_query()` + `_format_next_event()` in router.py
5. ✅ **Catch-up fast-path** — `_CATCHUP_TRIGGERS` + `_is_catchup_query()` in router.py
6. ✅ **Inbox read fast-path** — `_parse_message_read_query()` in router.py
7. ✅ **All 10 pre-existing test failures fixed** — meeting routing, message state, UI rendering

### Next Claude work (wave 3)
1. **Email reply flow** — "reply to that email from X" → show thread → draft → confirm → send via google_services.send_email()
2. **Proactive notification watcher** — background thread in api.py polling calendar (10-min lookahead) + urgent email; surfaces alert text to user
3. **Daily email digest** — "what are my emails about today?" fast-path → 3-bullet summary via jarvis-local
4. **Reminder fast-path** — "remind me at 3pm to X" → schedule via apple script or Google Calendar

### Router stable signal
router.py is stable as of commit b1dea6d. Codex can touch it for Codex-owned features.

## Codex / Claude sync - 2026-04-26 17:03 PDT

Claude's latest full-run artifact `bdafzegbl.output` listed 10 failures:
- meeting fast-path routing
- message confirmation state
- caption-assisted browser routing
- compact suggestion rendering
- inbox read route for `did Aman reply?`

Codex re-ran those exact cases against the current working tree and they now pass:

```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py -q --tb=short -k 'focus_meeting_fast_path or meeting_captions_fast_path or meeting_diagnostics_fast_path or meeting_safe_mode_enable_fast_path or meeting_safe_mode_status_fast_path or message_requires_confirmation_before_sending or pending_recipient_accepts_send_it_to_instead or caption_assisted_response_routes_to_browser_summarizer or compact_suggestion_rendering_shows_panel_and_refreshes_layout or did_contact_reply_routes_fast' -v
```

Result:
- `10 passed, 368 deselected`

Focused InboxRead verification also passed:
- `_parse_message_read_query("did Aman reply?")` returns `Aman`
- `route_stream("did Aman reply?")` returns label `Messages` with patched `messages.read_recent_thread`

Recommendation for Claude:
- Treat the 10-failure full-run output as stale relative to current `router.py`/`ui.py`.
- Wait for a fresh full regression result before making more route-order edits.
- Codex is staying out of `router.py` for now.

## Codex / Claude sync - 2026-04-26 17:07 PDT

Live beta finding:
- `/status` on `127.0.0.1:8765` responds.
- A live `/chat` fast-path request (`what time is it?`) timed out after 20 seconds while another chat/model lane was likely holding the API chat lock.
- The active listener restarted during Claude work and wrote a fresh runtime token:
  - pid `93673`
  - token in `.jarvis_runtime.json` written at `2026-04-27T00:02:35Z`

Codex patch:
- `api.py`: `/chat` now uses bounded `_CHAT_LOCK` acquisition.
- The timeout is configurable with `JARVIS_CHAT_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and falls back to `3.0` if the env var is invalid.
- If another request is already occupying the chat lane, normal and streaming `/chat` return HTTP `409` with `{"error": "chat_busy"}` instead of hanging indefinitely.
- `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py`: added two `ApiSurfaceTests` cases covering non-streaming and streaming busy responses.

Verification:
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py -q --tb=short -k 'ApiSurfaceTests and chat_returns_busy or ApiSurfaceTests and streaming_chat_returns_busy or protected_paths_accept_bearer_token or public_status_path_remains_visible' -v
./venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_local_beta_runtime tests.test_jarvis_health tests.test_voice_tts_regression tests.test_local_stt_runtime tests.test_local_tts_runtime -v
./venv/bin/python -m py_compile api.py
git diff --check
```

Result:
- focused API lock/auth tests: `4 passed`
- Codex-owned runtime/health/voice tests: `41 passed`
- `py_compile`: passed
- `git diff --check`: passed

Runtime note:
- The live process on port `8765` has not been restarted for this `api.py` change because Claude is actively using it.
- Restart Jarvis before live-testing the new `409 chat_busy` behavior.

Claude validation observed after sync:
- Fresh Claude full regression artifact `bk58dvjfg.output` completed cleanly:
  - `378 passed, 2 warnings in 450.00s`
- That run appears to have collected before Codex added the two API busy tests, so interpret it as validation for Claude's router/UI/message changes.
- Codex's API lock change is separately covered by the focused `4 passed` API slice above.

## Claude sync — 2026-04-26 late session

Confirmed: Codex's 10 test fixes + api.py 409 lock patch verified in main. Server restarted on PID 97482.

**Merged since last sync:**
- `messages.py`: `read_recent_thread()` — chat.db snapshot reader + thread store fallback
- `router.py`: `_parse_message_read_query()` fast-path, `_suggest_reply_from_context()` with jarvis-local
- `tools.py`: `_summarise_for_voice()` — 8s threaded ollama summary for long web results
- `jarvis_agents.py`: clean task bullets (strip checkbox/hashtag/wikilinks), vault silence, prewarm thread, 15s synthesis timeout, calendar string/list fix
- `tests/`: InboxReadFastPathTests (2), WebSearchSummaryTests (2) — all passing

**Router stable** — Codex safe to edit router.py again for non-conflicting additions.

**Claude queuing now (agents launching):**
- Calendar event prep fast-path: "meeting in 30 mins" → context surface
- Email urgency briefing agent in jarvis_agents.py
- "what did I miss" / away-summary fast-path

**Claude owns going forward (same as before + tools.py)**

## Claude Code session — 2026-06-06 (overnight)

### What was built this session

#### 1. Security: nmap aggressive flags unblocked for researcher use (`tools/security/hackingtool_adapter.py`)
- Removed `-T4`, `-T5`, `--script=vuln`, `--script=exploit`, `--script=intrusive` from `_BLOCKED_FLAGS`
- Updated nmap `allowed_args` regex from `-T[0-3]` to `-T[0-5]`
- Added `_NMAP_ALLOWED_SCRIPT_CATEGORIES` / `_NMAP_BLOCKED_SCRIPT_CATEGORIES` frozensets
- `--script=malware` still blocked; all external-target calls still route through `security_reviewer.review()` and `needs_approval=True`
- Test updated: `test_nmap_aggressive_timing_flags_pass_allowlist` (was `_are_blocked`)

#### 2. Four new agent workers (`agents/`)
- `frontend_designer.py` — tools: read_file, write_file; `needs_review: False`
- `ux_researcher.py` — tools: web_search, read_file; `needs_review: False`
- `qa_tester.py` — tools: read_file, write_file, run_tests; `needs_review: False`
- `devops_release.py` — tools: read_file, write_file, run_tests; **`needs_review: True`** (always gates through manager)
- All follow the `backend_engineer` pattern: memory recall → `ask_local_with_tools` → POST `/results`

#### 3. Generic agent dispatcher (`agents/agent_worker.py`)
- `_SUPPORTED_AGENTS` set: backend_engineer, frontend_designer, ux_researcher, qa_tester, devops_release, memory_librarian, researcher
- `_load_process_task(agent_name)` — importlib lazy load, avoids pulling all agents at startup
- `run_once(agent_name)` — polls SSE inbox, dispatches, returns `{ok, status, task_id}`
- `run_forever(agent_name)` — wraps run_once with idle sleep
- `main()` — argparse CLI: `python -m agents.agent_worker --agent researcher [--once] [--timeout-ms 5000]`

#### 4. Researcher agent (`agents/researcher.py`)
- Imports `deep_research` from `research.pipeline`; `_RESEARCH_AVAILABLE` flag controls graceful fallback
- Memory recall via `store.context_for_prompt()`; failure is non-fatal
- Formats output: report body + markdown source links + queries used
- Fallback when unavailable: `brains.brain_ollama.ask_local_stream`
- Posts to `/results` with `needs_review: False`, `X-Jarvis-Agent-ID: researcher`
- `researcher` added to `agent_worker._SUPPORTED_AGENTS`

#### 5. ADE — Autonomous Dev Environment (`ade/`)
Four new modules + CLI + scripts:

- **`ade/state.py`** — `.worktrees/.ade_state.json` persistence; `upsert/get/set_status/remove/load`
- **`ade/notify.py`** — `send(title, msg)`: osascript on Darwin, notify-send on Linux; non-fatal on failure
- **`ade/session.py`** — tmux session CRUD: `create/attach/kill/exists/list_sessions/session_pid`; raises `RuntimeError` if tmux missing or session already exists
- **`ade/loop.py`** — Plan→Execute→Verify→Retry loop
  - `detect_test_cmd(root)` auto-detects npm/make/pytest/cargo test runners
  - `_claude_prompt_cmd(prompt)` — `ADE_CLAUDE_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=1` opt-in for `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  - `phase_plan / phase_execute / phase_verify` with state transitions and notifications
  - MAX_RETRIES=3; verified tests must pass before marking DONE
- **`ade/cli.py`** — `cmd_start/list/watch/sync/stop` + **`cmd_approvals`** (new)
  - `cmd_approvals(approve_id, reject_id, reason)`: lists `/approvals/pending`, posts decision to event bus
- **`ade_cmd.py`** — top-level entry point
- **`scripts/ade-loop`** — executable Python shebang that calls `ade.loop.main()`
- **`scripts/setup.sh`** — tmux install (brew/apt), tmux defaults, ade-loop chmod, ~/bin/ade symlink

#### 6. Event bus: approval queue endpoints (`infra/event_bus.py`)
Three new endpoints added to the FastAPI app:
- `GET /approvals/{stream_id}` — fetch single pending item; 404 if not found
- `POST /approvals/{stream_id}` — `ApprovalDecision(decision, reason)`; approve publishes `task.approved` to STREAM_TASKS, reject publishes `task.rejected`; both xack
- `DELETE /approvals/{stream_id}` — dismiss without status event (xack only)
- `ApprovalDecision(BaseModel)` with `pattern="^(approve|reject)$"` validation

#### 7. Docker: 6 new worker services (`docker-compose.yml`)
```
frontend_designer_worker, ux_researcher_worker, qa_tester_worker,
devops_release_worker, memory_librarian_worker, researcher_worker
```
All: `Dockerfile.api`, `agents.agent_worker --agent <name>`, depend on `event_bus: service_healthy`.

#### 8. Tests: 239 passing (was ~180)

| File | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `test_agent_workers.py` | 14 | ✅ all pass |
| `test_researcher_agent.py` | 15 | ✅ all pass |
| `test_event_bus.py` | ~55 | ✅ all pass |
| `test_ade.py` | ~36 | ✅ all pass |
| All prior tests | ~119 | ✅ unchanged |

**Key fix applied this session:** `test_agent_worker_dispatches_to_frontend_designer` and `test_agent_worker_dispatches_to_researcher` both used the broken `sys.modules.pop + patch("string.path")` pattern. Fixed to `import agents.X as X` + `patch.object(X, "_load_process_task", ...)` so the patch binds to the actual live module object.

### Verification command (run to confirm clean state)
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_researcher_agent.py tests/test_event_bus.py \
  tests/test_ade.py tests/test_agent_workers.py tests/test_hackingtool_adapter.py \
  tests/test_manager.py tests/test_backend_engineer.py tests/test_agent_dispatch.py \
  tests/test_rbac.py tests/test_memory.py tests/test_memory_librarian.py -q
# Expected: 239 passed
```

### Known issues / still pending

1. **mem0 end-to-end with Qdrant** — `store.context_for_prompt()` logs `'QdrantClient' object has no attribute 'search'` in tests. Memory recall is non-fatal but live recall from Qdrant won't work until the QdrantClient API mismatch is resolved (likely version skew between qdrant-client and server).

2. **`third_party/hackingtool-plugin/VENDOR.md` SHA** — the TODO for pinning the git subtree commit SHA is still outstanding. User needs to run the git subtree command manually.

3. **`ade loop` not live-tested** — the `phase_plan → phase_execute → phase_verify → retry` loop is implemented and unit-tested, but has not been run end-to-end with a real task + real Claude CLI. Integration test when `tmux` + `claude` CLI are available.

4. **`ade approvals` requires live event bus** — `cmd_approvals` calls `http://localhost:8766/approvals/pending`. Needs `infra/event_bus.py` running with Redis.

## Codex OAuth Recovery Update - 2026-06-07 00:00 PDT

Scope kept intentionally narrow to avoid Claude's active `api.py` / `router.py` lane.

Applied:
- `google_services.py` now has a real CLI entrypoint:
  - `python google_services.py --reauth` clears the saved Google token, runs `InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server(port=0)`, and rewrites `~/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/token.json`
  - `python google_services.py --status` probes whether current Google auth is usable
- Added `clear_google_token()` and `reauthorize_google()` helpers so token reset is explicit and reusable.
- Added isolated tests in `tests/test_google_oauth_reauth.py` instead of touching Claude-owned regression files.

Observed live issue on this machine before the fix:
- Existing token refresh failed with `RefreshError: ('invalid_grant: Bad Request', ...)`
- Router/user guidance already told people to run `python google_services.py --reauth`, but that command previously did nothing because `google_services.py` had no `__main__` handler.

Deliberately not changed to avoid merge friction:
- `router.py` still mentions `jarvis-ai/auth`; that reconnect URL does not exist yet.
- `api.py` still only exposes `/auth/verify`; no browser reconnect endpoint was added in this Codex slice.

Verification:
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_google_oauth_reauth.py -q
./venv/bin/python google_services.py --help
git diff --check -- google_services.py tests/test_google_oauth_reauth.py CODEX_HANDOFF.md
```

## Codex Context Optimization Update - 2026-06-13

Applied:
- `context_budget.py` now has a real context governor (`estimate_tokens`, `target_tokens_for`, `compile_context_blocks`) instead of policy text only.
- `model_router.py` now compiles vault, graph, semantic memory, semantic hint, and mem0 blocks under one budget before appending them to `system_extra`.
- `brains/brain_ollama.py` now checks local prompt fit after the full prompt is assembled, not just against raw user input.
- Normal GLM local chat now sends `num_ctx=64000` by default via `GLM_CTX` / `OLLAMA_GLM_CONTEXT`, matching the local tool-calling lane.
- `tests/test_context_governor.py` covers budget priority dropping, router compilation, and GLM context options without hitting real Ollama.

Verification:
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_context_governor.py -q
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_smart_stream_context_hang.py tests/test_cloud_token_budget.py -q
./venv/bin/python -m py_compile context_budget.py model_router.py brains/brain_ollama.py
```

Result: `14 passed`, compile clean.

Recommended Claude next slice:
- Dashboard metric for context selected/dropped blocks.
- Ollama runtime setup helper for long-context local mode.
- Benchmark prompt tokens + latency before/after for chat/task/code/vault queries.
- Verify mem0 end-to-end: `fastembed` is installed and runtime import `mem0` is present at `2.0.2`; `mem0ai` is not the module name.

## Codex Manager Pipeline Canary Update - 2026-06-13

Applied:
- Added `tests/test_pipeline_canary.py` to exercise the real `/manager/run-stream` manager SSE path with eight specialist agents.
- The canary is local-only and side-effect free: decomposition, dispatch, eval, persistence, task background threads, approval, and worktree creation are mocked or disabled for the test.
- It verifies: plan event, eight start events, eight eval events, eight done events, complete event, dashboard-visible `task_runtime` records, succeeded status, debrief presence, and healthy `api._pipeline_health_check()`.
- Fixed `tests/test_eval_delta_unit.py` so branch-imported eval tests no longer poison other suites by installing fake `brains`/`config` modules during collection.

Verification:
```bash
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_canary.py -q
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_canary.py tests/test_agent_collaboration.py::TestAgentWorkerDispatch tests/test_agent_dispatch_integration.py -q
./venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_pipeline_canary.py tests/test_eval_delta_unit.py tests/test_context_governor.py tests/test_ollama_context_setup.py tests/test_orchestrate.py tests/test_preflect.py tests/test_ade.py tests/test_pipeline_audit.py tests/test_agent_collaboration.py tests/test_agent_dispatch_integration.py tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py::ApiSurfaceTests::test_agent_ops_dashboard_serves_current_runtime_javascript -q
```

Result: `185 passed`, `2 warnings`, `24 subtests passed`.

Recommended next slice:
- Run one live dashboard manager task with safe, read-only scope and watch the SSE stream/logs.
- If live canary is clean, wire a dashboard "Run Canary" button or documented command for periodic manager-loop checks.
- Only after the dirty tree is staged by logical groups, run the packaged app verification path.
