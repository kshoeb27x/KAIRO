"""TaskScheduler — asyncio + heapq-based scheduler (ADR-0005).

Simple, two paths:

1. **Time-based** (``after_delay`` + ``at_time``) — a min-heap ordered by
   ``due_at_ns``. The ``run()`` loop pops every due entry and dispatches it to
   the ``TaskRunner`` before waiting for the next one.

2. **Event-based** (``on_event``) — the scheduler registers itself as a
   wildcard subscriber on the bus and dispatches every event class that an
   ``on_event`` task has recorded as its ``event_selector``.

**No** cron semantics, **no** APScheduler, **no** second thread.
Everything runs on the main async loop — that is deliberate (ADR-0005).

The scheduler uses a ``CancelToken`` as its top-level abort condition
(ADR-0004). Running tasks get their own runner task, derived from this token.
