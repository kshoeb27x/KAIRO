# OpenMind — UI & Harness Overhaul (autonomous campaign)

Driver for `scripts/run-ui-overhaul.ps1`. Read `CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
**`docs/ui-overhaul-spec.md`** first, then this file. Spec = the locked design;
each issue body = that slice's detail.

---

## Next slice — start here

**UI/harness overhaul epic.** 20 tracer slices, one PR each, auto-merged to master
in order (every slice edits `tray/windows/main.html`, so unmerged parallel slices
would collide — they MUST land sequentially). Work strictly top-down through the
queue below: respect each slice's `Depends on:` (the order already satisfies it).
After landing a slice, **update this block**: tick the entry in the queue, set the
next unticked entry's `#N` + `Model:` as the active slice here, and set `Status:`
(`ready` while slices remain; `done` after S20 lands).

Active slice: **done**

Model: sonnet
Status: done

(`Model:`/`Status:` are read directly by `scripts/run-ui-overhaul.ps1`. Allowed:
haiku | sonnet | opus | fable. `Status: ready` = run the active slice; `blocked` =
needs a human; `done` = stop. Stop gracefully any time with
`scripts/stop-ui-overhaul.ps1`.)
