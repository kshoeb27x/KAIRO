"""Self-dev git/gh/pytest I/O -- lives OUTSIDE plugins/ on purpose.

`plugins/self_dev.py` is scanned by the ADR-0005 inspectability gate, which
forbids `subprocess.run(` in any inspected plugin body. The self-dev loop
genuinely has to shell out to git / gh / pytest, so those calls live here
(cerebral/ is not scanned) and the plugin imports them -- the same split
`plugins/shell.py` uses to route through `cerebral.sandbox`.

Kept as thin module-level functions so `plugins.self_dev` can re-alias them as
its `_default_*_fn` seams and the existing tests (which monkeypatch the global
`subprocess.run`) keep working unchanged.

    used to run cerebral/tests/ only, so a self-dev change that added a broken
    test under tests/ (repo root) passed the gate and auto-merged red -- exactly
    how #723 landed a failing tests/test_router_usage.py on master. Any dir that
    is absent in the clone is simply skipped by pytest, so this stays safe when
    a repo has only one test root.

    Bounded by _TEST_TIMEOUT_S: a hung/runaway test (e.g. a fixture waiting on
    a real network call) used to block this subprocess.run forever, and since
    the caller (plugins/self_dev.py) invokes this synchronously inside an async
    handler, an unbounded hang froze the whole Cerebral event loop -- no WS, no
    heartbeats, nothing -- until someone force-killed the process. A timeout
    turns that into a failed slice instead of a dead app.

    SUP-0 (ADR-0033): `tray/` is a GUARDRAIL_PATHS entry precisely because this
    gate used to run pytest only and could not validate JS -- since the
    2026-08-21 full-auto-merge amendment, that guardrail hit is informational
    and no longer blocks merge, so an untested tray/ change would otherwise
    land straight into the restart/rollback path self_dev itself depends on.
    A diff touching `tray/` now also runs the tray's own `npm test` (jest);
    both suites must pass.

    `tray/node_modules` is gitignored, so a fresh clone never has it -- ensured
    by linking the live repo's already-installed copy in (see
    `_ensure_tray_node_modules`) rather than reinstalling. This used to just skip
    jest when missing, which meant jest silently never ran on ANY self-dev
    tray/ change: PR #1113 (SUP-2b) merged with 4 failing jest tests -- the very
    tests it added itself -- because "missing -> skip" reported the same
    `passed` as pytest alone, with nothing to say jest never touched the diff
    it was meant to guard. Still skipped (not failed) if linking somehow fails
    or `npm` is unavailable, so a genuinely broken host degrades to the old
    pytest-only gate rather than blocking every tray/ change outright.
