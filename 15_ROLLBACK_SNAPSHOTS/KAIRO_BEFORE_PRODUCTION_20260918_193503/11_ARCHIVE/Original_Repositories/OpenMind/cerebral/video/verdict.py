"""Validity verdict per cluster -- ADR-0017 S6 #644.

First video in a new cluster triggers a strong-model + web-search validity
pass; every later video in that cluster inherits the verdict instantly.

Verdict: legit / dubious / scam / unverifiable
  + confidence (0.0-1.0) + evidence (list of 1-3 URLs/strings).

S9 #655: the model is Budd (or local), grounded on Felix's own web_search
(OpenClaw) -- no Anthropic API key. build_verdict_prompt() is a pure helper the
prod seam uses so the RAG prompt is unit-testable without any network.

Injectable seam:
  set_verify_fn(async fn(cluster_label, idea_text, category) -> dict)
  fn must return {"verdict": str, "confidence": float, "evidence": list[str]}.

Tests always set the seam to a stub; no network/API key required.
