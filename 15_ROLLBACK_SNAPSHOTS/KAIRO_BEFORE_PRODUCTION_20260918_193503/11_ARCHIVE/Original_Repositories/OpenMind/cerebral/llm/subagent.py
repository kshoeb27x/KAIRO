"""Sub-agent delegation -- run a chain inside its own context boundary (ADR-0020).

A sub-agent is NOT a parallel worker (single 8 GB GPU serializes local
inference); it is a context boundary. run_subagent runs a bounded subtask on
a fresh transcript with a scoped tool subset, reusing the caller's gate +
executor + router, and returns ONE compact result. The parent's token budget
stays clean: the sub-chain's intermediate steps never flow up, and (via the
no-op record_fn) never touch the conversation store.

v1 is caller-invoked only -- the planner is NOT handed a delegate tool yet;
that autonomy slice comes behind the eval harness (ADR-0020 S4). Sequential/
blocking by design: parallel local would thrash the one GPU.
