**MIRA** is a self-hosted personal AI agent. You run it on your own hardware; it
talks to whichever LLM provider you configure, reaches you on real channels
(web, Signal, Telegram, email, push…), remembers you, and acts through tools.

New here? Start with **[What is MIRA?](concepts/overview.md)**, then
**[Install MIRA](getting-started/installation.md)**.

## Documentation map

## Contributing to the docs

These docs are written for end users and feed the Vexillon documentation site
directly. If you're adding or editing a page, read
**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** first — it covers the Diátaxis structure,
the required frontmatter, and the house style so the site build stays a clean
pass-through.

> Looking for *engineering* design docs (architecture, phase plans)? Those are
> kept internally and are not part of this site.
