Most assistants only answer when asked. MIRA can **start the conversation** —
a periodic check-in to see how you're doing, or a morning briefing built from
your calendar, wiki, and recent activity. This guide turns those on.

Both features are **per-user** and **opt-in**, and both need a connected
channel so MIRA has somewhere to reach you. If you haven't set one up yet, do
that first: see **[Connect a channel](connect-a-channel.md)**. Telegram is the
quickest to start with.

You **enable and tune** companion behaviour on the **Presence** page (rhythm,
personality, what MIRA sends, and the daily briefing) — or just by asking MIRA in
chat. **Device pairing, browser push, and the test buttons** live under
**My Preferences → Notifications & devices**, which every user can reach. (When
you finish onboarding, MIRA already configures Presence from your answers —
admins are switched on automatically; others enable once a safety contact is
set.)

## Turn on companion check-ins

Companion mode is what lets MIRA message you on its own — gentle, periodic
check-ins rather than replies to your prompts. It's designed to feel like a
friend who knows you, not an alarm clock: MIRA varies its timing, learns when
you tend to reply, and backs off when you're brief or busy.

1. Go to the **Presence** page and **enable companion mode** for your account.
2. **Choose a preferred channel** for the check-ins (for example Telegram or
   Signal). This is where the proactive messages will arrive. If you leave it
   unset, MIRA uses whichever surface you last talked to it on — including the
   **web app** or the **native mobile app**, which both receive check-ins and
   the morning briefing as **push notifications** (register a device under
   My Preferences → Notifications & devices so a check-in can actually reach you there).
3. **Set your quiet hours** — the windows when MIRA must never message you (for
   example overnight, or during a regular nap). MIRA respects these absolutely;
   it won't reach out inside a quiet window no matter what.

That's enough to start. MIRA picks varied times within your allowed windows,
skips a check-in if you've just been chatting, and adjusts how often it reaches
out based on whether you tend to engage.

> Companion mode is usually set up **for** someone — an admin or family member
> configures it on the person's behalf — but you can also enable it for
> yourself. Either way it's strictly per-user: people without it enabled get
> normal MIRA behaviour.

### Tune the rhythm (Settings → Presence)

MIRA's timing is a **fuzzy band**, not a fixed schedule:

- **Messages per day** — a range like "1–4 a day". MIRA picks a count in that
  band each day and scatters them at **varied, non-round times** inside your
  contactable hours (each at least a minimum gap apart). *"Message me once or
  twice a day."*
- **Minimum gap** — the least time between two reach-outs (default 90 minutes).
- It **leans in** when you're engaging and **backs off** when you're brief or
  not replying — and **pauses after a few unanswered**, resuming the moment you
  reply, so MIRA never talks into the void.

Prefer predictable times instead? Switch the rhythm to **Scheduled** and give it
fixed times (e.g. 09:00 and 18:00). Everything is also adjustable in chat —
*"only check in in the mornings"*, *"leave more time between messages"*.

### Give MIRA personality (what it sends, and how)

On the Presence page you also shape *what* a reach-out is and *how it sounds*:

- **Message types** — toggle which kinds MIRA may send: a **check-in**, a
  **joke**, **"what I've been up to"** (it'll genuinely mention what its
  background agents did for you), a **follow-up** on something you recently
  discussed, a **share**, or a bit of **encouragement**. MIRA picks one per
  reach-out, biased by context.
- **Tone** — three sliders (warmth / playfulness / verbosity) with quick presets
  ("Warm & chatty", "Calm & concise", "Playful", "Professional"); for deeper
  voice, edit MIRA's **persona** wiki page.
- Or just say it: *"be funnier"*, *"stop the jokes"*, *"keep it short"*.

Each person's settings override the instance-wide defaults an admin sets in the
`companion` config block. The daily briefing is separate and isn't affected by
these limits.

## The care network

Presence can be more than friendly company: it can be a quiet **wellbeing net**
for someone you look out for — a child, or an older parent living
independently. If the person seems to be having a hard time, or simply goes
quiet, MIRA gives a trusted contact a gentle heads-up so a real human can check
in. You set this up on the **Settings → Presence** page under **Care network**.

It's built on four principles:

- **Never covert.** MIRA always tells the person, in plain language, that it's
  looking out for them and may give their contact a heads-up. The first time a
  care arrangement is active, MIRA works this disclosure naturally into a
  check-in. The "the person knows" acknowledgement on the Presence page records
  that this has happened.
- **Concern, not tattling.** Only genuine signals escalate — clear distress, or
  a run of unanswered check-ins. An ordinary off day doesn't trigger anything;
  MIRA just responds warmly. Repeat alerts for the same signal are suppressed.
- **A heads-up, not 911.** The contact gets a short, factual note — "you might
  want to check in" — so a person who knows them can follow up. MIRA escalates
  to that human; it does **not** call emergency services. In parallel, MIRA
  responds to the person warmly and surfaces crisis resources to *them*.
- **Minimal disclosure.** The contact sees a one- or two-sentence summary of the
  signal and the person's name — never the full conversation.

### Choose a care role

On the Presence page, pick who Presence is for:

- **Just me** — a companion for yourself. No one gets an ongoing *wellbeing
  view* of you, but your **safety contact** is still alerted in a genuine
  emergency (distress or a run of unanswered check-ins) — the care network isn't
  only for children and older adults, and an ordinary adult can absolutely want
  people to turn to when something's wrong. This is the default.
- **An adult who needs support** — for a grown-up who *wants* someone actively
  looking out for them: recovery, a chronic condition, living alone, a hard
  stretch. Like the child/older-adult roles, a care contact is alerted on
  distress or silence **and** — once you've been told and have consented — can
  see your aggregate **wellbeing view**. The difference is tone: it's a peer
  arrangement, no age framing.
- **A child** — a guardian is alerted if their child seems to be struggling;
  MIRA keeps a gentle, age-aware tone.
- **An older adult** — a contact is alerted on silence or signs of distress — a
  light-touch wellbeing check for someone living more independently.

The child and older-adult roles additionally expose a quiet **wellbeing view** to
the guardian (aggregate engagement over a trailing window — never the person's
messages), gated on the person having been told. The *Just me* role never exposes
that view; it's the framing/consent that differs, not whether a contact is
reached in an emergency. How serious a signal is tunes the message: an *acute*
signal (mentions of self-harm, or acute physical symptoms) sends an urgent
heads-up and shows the person crisis resources prominently; a *concerning* one
(a low mood, loneliness) sends a softer "you might want to check in".

### Set a safety contact

When you configure check-ins, set a **safety contact**: the person MIRA notifies
if check-ins go unanswered (three in a row over 48 hours) or if a message reads
as distress. (Choosing a care role above sets this same contact.) Pick them by
**searching for their name** — you don't need to know their internal user id.

You can name **more than one** contact — for example both parents of a child, or
two adult children looking after an older parent. A distress or missed-check-in
alert reaches **all** of them, and it counts as delivered if it reaches any one,
so a single unreachable contact never silences the alert.

The safety contact is a hard prerequisite for ordinary user accounts — you
can't enable companion check-ins without one — because a feature that holds
daily conversations with a vulnerable person needs somewhere to turn when
something's wrong.

The heads-up reaches the contact **on their own messaging channel** — whichever
they last used with MIRA (Signal, Telegram, email, and so on) — so it lands on
their phone, not just a web page they may not have open. It's also recorded in a
"Safety alerts" thread in their MIRA web account as a durable copy, and a
contact who only uses the web still gets it there. If the messaging channel
can't be reached, MIRA falls back to the web record and flags the delivery
problem on the health page rather than failing silently.

## Turn on the daily briefing

The daily briefing is a single morning summary, assembled from:

- your **calendar** — what's coming up today,
- recent **wiki** updates — notes you've added or changed,
- recent **activity** — automation runs and the like,
- **pending approvals** — anything waiting on your sign-off (see below).

To enable it:

1. On the **Presence** page, **enable the daily briefing**.
2. **Set the hour** it should arrive (for example 7 for 7am). You can change it
   any time — or just ask MIRA: *"set my briefing hour to 7"*.

The briefing arrives on your connected channel. If your host was asleep or
restarting at the scheduled time, the briefing catches up later the same day.

## Stay on top of pending approvals

Some things MIRA proposes wait for your explicit sign-off before they take
effect — for example a **schedule the agent created for you** (when the approval
gate is on) or a **wiki edit** sitting in the review queue. Left alone, these can
quietly pile up.

So MIRA reminds you: when anything is awaiting approval, your **daily briefing**
and your **companion check-ins** include a short nudge — *"you have 2 schedules
and 1 wiki edit waiting for your approval"*. (A briefing with nothing else going
on will still send when approvals are pending, so they don't slip through.)

You can act on them right there by **replying** — no need to open the dashboard:

- *"summarise what's pending"* → MIRA lists each item (what the schedule does,
  what the wiki edit changes).
- *"approve all"*, or *"approve the backup schedule"* → MIRA approves what you
  named (or everything).

The reminder is just a reminder: **MIRA only approves when you tell it to** — it
never approves on its own, and never inside the proactive message itself. The
human-in-the-loop review stays with you. (You can still approve from the
**Automations** and **Wiki review** pages in the UI if you prefer.)

## Test it right now

You don't have to wait for the next scheduled moment to confirm everything
works. Under **My Preferences → Notifications & devices** there are two test buttons:

- **Send a check-in now** — fires a companion check-in immediately.
- **Send a briefing now** — starts building today's briefing and delivers it on
  your channel when it's ready. Because a briefing is a full generation pass, the
  button returns right away and the briefing follows a few moments later (it
  doesn't block while it's written) — so it won't hang the app on a slow model.

Use these to confirm the message actually reaches your chosen channel before
relying on the schedule.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing arrives.** Confirm you have a [connected channel](connect-a-channel.md)
  and that it's set as your preferred channel for notifications. On Telegram,
  MIRA can only message you proactively after you've **linked your chat**
  (Settings → My channels → Link Telegram, then send the `LINK-XXXX-XXXX` code to
  the bot) — that's how it captures your chat id.
- **A check-in never came.** Check-ins and briefings only fire while MIRA is
  **running** at the scheduled moment. If the host was asleep or restarting,
  that window can be missed — the briefing catches up later the same day, but
  check-ins don't replay.
- **I want to pause for a while.** Just tell MIRA — for example *"pause the
  check-ins for the weekend"*. It accepts the request without pushing back.
