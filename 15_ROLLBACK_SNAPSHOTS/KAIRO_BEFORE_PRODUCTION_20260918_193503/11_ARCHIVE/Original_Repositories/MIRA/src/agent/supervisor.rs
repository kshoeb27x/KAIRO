//! Spawn + supervise a worker Agent (slice B3).
//!
//! Manager-side API: `Supervisor::spawn_worker` creates an Agent,
//! registers it, spawns the runtime tasks, and hands back a
//! [`WorkerHandle`] whose `completion` future resolves with the
//! terminal outcome.
//!
//! Worker-side runtime: a tokio task that
//!   1. Awaits the manager's `Assign` request, replies `Accepted`
//!      (rejection paths land later when WorkerTask gains a "can I
//!      handle this?" check).
//!   2. Marks the Agent as `Running`.
//!   3. Calls the user-supplied `WorkerTask::run` with a
//!      [`WorkerContext`] that lets the executor emit `Progress`
//!      events.
//!   4. Translates the `Result` into a terminal `Complete` /
//!      `Failed` event and updates the Agent state to match.
//!
//! Manager-side runtime: a sibling tokio task that
//!   1. Sends the `Assign` request.
//!   2. Receives Events and Requests from the worker.
//!   3. Resolves `Progress` to a `current_step` update.
//!   4. Resolves the first `Complete` / `Failed` to a `WorkerOutcome`,
//!      updates Agent state, and fires the completion oneshot.
//!   5. For requests we don't yet handle (RequestReview /
//!      RequestUserInput / SpawnChild), replies with a polite
//!      placeholder so the worker isn't left hanging — proper
//!      handling lands in B6 (spawn approval) and beyond.
//!
//! Out of scope for this slice (tracked elsewhere):
//! - Pause / Resume / Interrupt propagation (B5)
//! - Real LLM-driven worker executors (Phase C adapters)
//! - Cost accounting from real LLM calls (B4)
//! - Spawn-child approval logic (B6)
