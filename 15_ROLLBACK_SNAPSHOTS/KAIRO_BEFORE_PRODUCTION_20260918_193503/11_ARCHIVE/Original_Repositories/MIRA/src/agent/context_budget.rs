// src/agent/context_budget.rs
//! Phase 1 — token-aware context budgeting.
//! Replaces the fixed `max_context_turns` window with a real token budget
//! derived from the model's context length, filling the window efficiently
//! instead of sending a near-constant slice regardless of what fits.
//!
//! Pure logic (unit-tested); the agent path and the `bench context` harness both
//! call [`history_fit`] so the measured gain reflects the real selection.
