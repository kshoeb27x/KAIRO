# architecture-tree-whitelist — fail when an unexpected file appears under
# `docs/architecture/`. Each directory has a known set of allowed files and
# filename patterns. Anything outside the whitelist signals that:
#
#   - someone wrote a verifier snapshot, scratch note, or AI artifact into
#     the architecture set (drift the moment the next pass runs), OR
#   - someone added a new directory without following PROCESS.md, OR
#   - a typo / wrong location for an otherwise legitimate file.
#
# Each new component / ADR / mapping that needs a new file shape must:
#   1. follow PROCESS.md "Adding a <thing>",
#   2. update this whitelist in the same PR.
#
# Run from repo root: scripts/docs-lint/architecture-tree-whitelist.sh
