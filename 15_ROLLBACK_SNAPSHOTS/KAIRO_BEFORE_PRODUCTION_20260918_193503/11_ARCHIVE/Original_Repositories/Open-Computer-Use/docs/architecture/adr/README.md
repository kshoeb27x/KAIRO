Architecture Decision Records. One file per decision. ADRs appear on demand following the decision tree in `CLAUDE.md`; no bulk-creation of empty stubs.

## Template

[`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md) — copy when starting a new ADR.

## Lifecycle

`proposed` → `accepted` (on PR merge) → `superseded` (when replaced by a later ADR; both files cross-link via front-matter).

`deprecated` is for decisions that no longer apply but were not superseded by a specific replacement.

## ADR threshold

An ADR is for decisions that are:

- **Load-bearing** — other components rely on this being decided one way.
- **Hard to reverse** — undoing it costs more than a typical refactor.
- **Cross-component** — affects at least two components or boundaries.

Decisions that don't meet the bar belong inline in the relevant component spec. See `CLAUDE.md` decision tree §3 for the test.

## Hard cap

Each ADR ≤ 200 lines. If it doesn't fit, the decision is too big — split it.
