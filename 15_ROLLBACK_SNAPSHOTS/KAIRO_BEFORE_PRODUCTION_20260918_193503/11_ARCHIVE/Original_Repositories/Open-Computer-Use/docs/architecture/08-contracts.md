Names every boundary that carries a wire contract, the format each uses, and whether OCU defines or conforms to it. Audience: engineers about to author a schema file or a component spec.

## 1. Contract surfaces

A contract at this layer is the typed, versioned shape that crosses a boundary — the methods, payloads, errors, and auth a caller may rely on. This overview owns the inventory, the format choice, and the policy; the per-surface schema files (§5) own the field-level types. Surfaces are the [internal boundaries](05-c4-container.md) (Layer 6 §4) plus the [external actors](03-c4-context.md) (Layer 4 §4); their token classes and zones live in those layers and are not restated here. [`diagrams/08-contracts.mmd`](diagrams/08-contracts.mmd) overlays the format on each crossing of the container diagram; the table below is the full surface list.

OCU does not define every contract it speaks. Five external surfaces are integration contracts the platform consumes — naming a bespoke OCU format for them would contradict the [context map](04-bounded-contexts.md) (Layer 5 §4): MCP authorization (Conformist), OIDC (relying-party), PKCS#11/KMIP (relying-party), chained-proxy, and ICAP. The overview presents these as conform/relying-party, citing the public spec, not an OCU schema.

| Surface | Boundary (canonical name) | Format | Role | NFR anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent tool-call ingress | Caller → MCP gateway | MCP JSON-Schema | conform | NFR-FLEX-14, NFR-IC-04 |
| Operator REST | Operator → Control / operator API | OpenAPI 3.1 | define | — |
| IdP assertion | Customer IdP → Control / operator API | OIDC | relying-party | NFR-COMP-29 |
| SOAR revoke (inbound) | SOAR → Control / operator API | OpenAPI 3.1 | define | NFR-SEC-01 |
| Session set-up RPC | MCP gateway → Control / operator API | Protobuf/gRPC | define | NFR-IC-04 |
| Exec / PTY+CDP | Control / operator API → Session sandbox | WebSocket, single per session (tagged-JSON control + binary stream frames) | define | NFR-IC-03, NFR-SEC-43 |
| File-operation mount | Storage broker → Session sandbox | file-operation interface — HTTP+JSON mount config (`filesystem_id`, broker-signed lease) over a FUSE/virtio-fs/9p substrate | define | NFR-SEC-25 |
| File / artifact data plane (north face) | Data-plane client → Storage broker (north face) | OpenAPI 3.1 (HTTP+JSON: upload/list/download/getManifest/preview-render + embeddable SPA) | define | NFR-SEC-78, NFR-SEC-82, NFR-SEC-49, NFR-SEC-73 |
| Secret delivery | SDS source → Egress trust-edge | Envoy SDS (gRPC xDS) | wire off-the-shelf; the dynamic per-SNI minter implementing the SDS server is OCU code ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-egress-auth-mechanism.md)), the file SDS source is off-the-shelf | NFR-SEC-29 |
| Outbound | Session sandbox → Egress trust-edge | network policy (no wire schema) | network property | NFR-SEC-27 |
| Broker backend leg | Storage broker → backend engine (network leg via the storage lane on the Egress trust-edge, ADR-0011) | external backend protocol (pluggable adapter, ADR-0010) | conform | NFR-SEC-16, NFR-SEC-25, NFR-SEC-85 |
| Audit fan-in / SIEM | five containers → Audit pipeline → SIEM | AsyncAPI 3.0 / OCSF | publish | NFR-SEC-03 |
| SOAR webhook (outbound) | Audit pipeline → SOAR | AsyncAPI 3.0 | define | NFR-COMP-27 |
| Transparency-log submission | Audit pipeline → log | submission envelope | define (envelope only) | NFR-SEC-03 |
| KMS / proxy / DLP | Egress trust-edge ↔ customer substrate | PKCS#11 · chained-proxy · ICAP | relying-party / conform | NFR-FLEX-04, NFR-COMP-28, NFR-FLEX-15 |

Protobuf/gRPC is the unary session set-up leg only (create, route, destroy a session). The mount config is HTTP+JSON and the exec stream is a WebSocket. The file-op message-set substrate (Connect-RPC over HTTP/2) is a component-spec choice, not part of the contract. Egress secret delivery rides Envoy's native Secret Discovery Service (gRPC xDS); it is off-the-shelf and not an OCU-defined contract.

The broker backend leg and the transparency log are mixed-ownership: OCU defines its half and conforms to the backend's API or the log operator's Merkle-head signing.

The Storage broker has two faces on one client: the south mount (above) and the north file/artifact data plane, served on a dedicated file/UI ingress, not the MCP-tool-call listener (NFR-SEC-78). The transport substrate under each into-sandbox leg (TCP / UDS / vsock for the exec channel; FUSE / virtio-fs / 9p for the mount) is a deployment-overlay and component-spec choice, not a contract (NFR-SEC-26, NFR-SEC-25). What the contract fixes is channel direction, per channel: the control/exec channel is host-dialled — the host opens it and a non-host peer is rejected at accept (NFR-SEC-43); the outbound leg runs the opposite way, guest-out and intercepted at the edge under egress policy (NFR-SEC-27).

## 2. Format choice

Five formats cover every surface OCU defines; the choice follows the boundary shape, not preference.

- **MCP JSON-Schema (over JSON-RPC 2.0)** — the agent tool surface. The protocol fixes the format; OCU does not choose it. Tool definitions carry JSON Schema; an embedded schema defaults to JSON Schema 2020-12 and may declare another dialect with `$schema`, so the validator honours the declared dialect and falls back to 2020-12 ([MCP spec 2025-06-18](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools)).
- **OpenAPI 3.1** — inbound human/operator and third-party REST (operator API, SOAR revoke) and the north-face file/artifact data plane (upload/list/download/getManifest/preview-render), an HTTP+JSON surface served on a dedicated ingress. SDK-generatable; its schemas are JSON Schema 2020-12 ([3.1 alignment](https://learn.openapis.org/upgrading/v3.0-to-v3.1.html)), the same dialect MCP defaults to, so inbound validation reads one dialect across both surfaces.
- **Protobuf/gRPC** — unary internal RPC between OCU containers, where both ends version together: session set-up. Field-number rules plus `buf breaking` give machine-checked compatibility with no public-SDK obligation. Internal-only by policy. Egress secret delivery is Envoy SDS (gRPC xDS) between Envoy and the SDS source: the wire is off-the-shelf and not an OCU RPC surface, but the dynamic per-SNI minter that implements the SDS server for a non-enumerable allow-list is self-hosted OCU code ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-egress-auth-mechanism.md)); the file SDS source needs none.
- **WebSocket** — the bidirectional exec/PTY+CDP surface, one socket per session. A PTY carries interleaved stdin/stdout/stderr bytes plus in-band resize and signal control, so the frame is tagged-JSON control alongside raw binary stream frames, not a unary call (NFR-IC-03). gRPC fits request/response, not a live byte stream, which is why this surface is WebSocket and the set-up RPC is not.
- **AsyncAPI 3.0** — one-directional decoupled event fan-in to the Audit pipeline and fan-out to SIEM. Payload is the OCSF Published Language; AsyncAPI names the channel, OCSF types the event ([AsyncAPI 3.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts/asyncapi-document/define-payload)).

## 3. Contract-enforced mitigations

Every OCU-defined contract carries the Layer 7 mitigations as machine-checked constraints. The overview states the property and where it is enforced; the schema states the constraint values. Threats are anchored in [the threat model](06-threat-model.md) (Layer 7) and not restated.

| Mitigation | Property the contract must carry | NFR |
|---|---|---|
| Audience-validated authz | reject any token not naming this surface in its audience ([trust-boundaries §3](02-trust-boundaries.md)); no token passthrough to upstream — the edge injects the SDS-delivered credential (NFR-SEC-23, NFR-SEC-27) | NFR-SEC-09 |
| Bounded error verbosity | caller gets a stable reason code; `error.message`/`error.data` leak no internal topology or stack | NFR-SEC-51 |
| Structured deny | deny is a machine-parseable object using the `x-deny-reason` vocabulary | NFR-SEC-17 |
| Schema validation | every payload validates against the published schema; reject on violation | NFR-SEC-51 |
| Bounded payload | gateway/REST/gRPC bound body size, array length, and object depth at the closed schema; the broker and exec transport cap max-message/max-object | NFR-SEC-51, NFR-SEC-46 |
| Bounded north-face inbound body | reject a body above the configured ceiling (default ≤50 MiB) pre-buffer, never partially staged; per-validated-caller op/byte rate limits on a dedicated file/UI ingress | NFR-SEC-78 |
| Archive validation | reject pre-extraction on uncompressed-total / entry-count / traversal / symlink ceilings | NFR-SEC-80 |
| Content classification | resolve content type on ingest (magic-byte + declared media type), record before mount-visibility; pre-stage deny on a policy-denied type | NFR-SEC-81 |
| Embed-token verify | reject any embed token not signature-valid, not naming this surface in audience, or past `exp` (`exp ≤ 120 s`); no OCU upstream secret crosses to the browser | NFR-SEC-82 |
| Frame-ancestors allowlist | every UI/artifact response carries `CSP: frame-ancestors` from the per-deployment allowlist (header-only, default `'none'`) | NFR-SEC-83 |
| First-party session + CSRF | a state-mutating request requires a server-validated CSRF token; a missing/invalid session is 401 with no anonymous fallback | NFR-SEC-84 |
| File-activity audit (north) | every upload/list/download/delete emits an OCSF File System Activity event into the hash-chained pipeline, gateway-authored, fail-closed | NFR-SEC-79 |
| Three-axis authz | resolve scope (`filesystem_id`) + intent (`read`/`write`/`preview`) + `downloadable` broker-side from the host-attested session, never a client-supplied claim; `intent=preview` is read-only and non-downloadable | NFR-SEC-49 |
| Downloadable axis at read | the broker resolves `downloadable` at read on both faces; a non-downloadable object yields no egress-eligible artifact (preview ≠ remove-from-sandbox) | NFR-SEC-73 |

The MCP edge carries the same five through a two-tier error model: a protocol error (`JSON-RPC error{code,message}`) never reaches the model and carries a reason code only; a tool-execution error (`result.isError: true` + content) reaches the model with sanitized output. Both are bounded by NFR-SEC-51.

## 4. Versioning & compatibility

Contracts evolve additively. Adding an endpoint, an optional field, a new event type, or a proto field with a fresh field number is non-breaking and ships without a version bump; consumers ignore unknown fields. Removing or renaming a field, tightening a type, changing an error envelope, or repurposing a proto field number is breaking and requires a new **major** version that does not depend on the prior one; the two coexist for the published transition window. Deprecation precedes removal — ship the replacement, migrate clients, then remove. REST deprecation uses the `Deprecation` ([RFC 9745](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9745.html)) and `Sunset` ([RFC 8594](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8594.html)) response headers. Breaking-change detection is CI-enforced — `oasdiff` for OpenAPI, `buf breaking` for Protobuf.

The control-plane RPC rule (breaking = major version + deprecation header) is canonical in NFR-IC-04 and governs OCU's own Control/operator API and internal gRPC. The MCP gateway is a Conformist to the MCP wire contract and does not carry semver: its revision is a date string (`protocolVersion: "2025-06-18"`) negotiated on `initialize` and echoed on every HTTP request via `MCP-Protocol-Version`. A revision the peer cannot negotiate is the breaking signal — the server returns an alternate version it supports and a client that cannot accept it disconnects ([MCP lifecycle](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle)); the spec's example initialization error is `-32602` "Unsupported protocol version". This negotiation path, not an HTTP `Deprecation` header, is the deprecation mechanism NFR-IC-04 describes for that edge. Concurrency is sequential-default per session with opt-in parallelism (NFR-IC-05); PTY and CDP multiplex one WebSocket per session (NFR-IC-03).

## 5. Schema artifacts

This overview is the map; the schema files under `contracts/` own the field-level types. Six schema files are drafted (the storage surface carries three — mount config, south-face file-op RPC, north-face file/artifact API); the rest are not yet built. [`contracts/README.md`](../../contracts/README.md) is the navigator: how to read a schema file and what the `x-ocu-*` annotations mean.

Drafted (not merged):

- `contracts/mcp/2025-06-18/ocu-constraints.schema.json` — the MCP conform profile.
- `contracts/exec/exec-channel.schema.json` — the exec/PTY WebSocket envelope.
- `contracts/storage/mount-config.schema.json` and `contracts/storage/file-ops.schema.json` — the south-face mount config and file-op RPC (the file-op message bodies are tbd).
- `contracts/storage/file-artifact-api.schema.json` — the north-face file/artifact data plane (upload/list/download/getManifest/preview-render + the embed-token/CSP/CSRF envelope). Per-operation bodies are tbd, like the south face; the embed-token binding claim ([#217](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/217)) and preview-render parser isolation ([#218](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/218)) are tracked open items.
- `contracts/audit/audit-fanin.asyncapi.yaml` — the OCSF fan-in (the compute-metering and saturation payloads are tbd, [#150](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/150)).

Not built:

- `contracts/openapi/` (operator REST + SOAR revoke) and `contracts/proto/` (session set-up) — [#205](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/205). Egress secret delivery is off-the-shelf Envoy SDS, not an OCU contract file.
- The transparency-log submission envelope — [#151](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/151).
- Mock / conformance servers per surface for consumer CI — [#206](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/206).
- The `SkillProvider` contract is a v1 non-goal; skills load from a customer-provided registry, so no skill-format schema ships in v1.

## 6. Open questions

1. Does NFR-IC-04 bind only the Control/operator API and internal gRPC, leaving the MCP gateway governed solely by date-revision negotiation, or does it need an explicit MCP-edge clause? — [#207](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/207).
2. Is the inbound gateway contract MCP-only per NFR-FLEX-14, and is `REST fallback` (used in Layer 4 prose, undefined in glossary) dropped or promoted to a defined surface? — [#158](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/158).
3. The §4 additive-vs-breaking rules, transition window, RFC 9745/8594 headers, and the `oasdiff`/`buf breaking` CI gates extend NFR-IC-04 across two surfaces — should this versioning policy move to a dedicated ADR, leaving §4 a pointer? — [#209](https://github.com/Wide-Moat/open-computer-use/issues/209).
