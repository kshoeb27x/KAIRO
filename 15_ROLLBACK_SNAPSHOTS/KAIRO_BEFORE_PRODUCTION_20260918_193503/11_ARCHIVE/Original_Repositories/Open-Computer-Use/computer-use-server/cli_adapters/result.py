"""Normalised sub-agent result type returned by every CLI adapter.

cost_usd is Optional because non-Claude CLIs (codex, opencode) do not
surface a USD cost in their JSON output (Pitfall 4 in PITFALLS.md).
None is rendered as "cost: unavailable" in the result string by the
caller; never as "$0.00" (which would be operator-misleading).

turns and session_id are Optional for the same reason — codex/opencode
do not emit equivalent fields. The Claude adapter populates them when
present in the parsed JSON.

raw_events is reserved for future cost computation (model→price tables)
and debugging; Phase 4 leaves it empty for the Claude adapter.

returncode is the underlying CLI process exit code, captured so the
caller can render distinct user-facing messages for rc=124 (timeout),
rc=137 (SIGKILL), rc=143 (SIGTERM) — preserves v0.9.2.0 UX through
the dispatch refactor.
