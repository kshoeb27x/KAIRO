Tier 6 — uploaded files exposed as native MCP resources.

Clients (Agents SDK, MCP Inspector, Claude Desktop) can call `resources/list`
to see every uploaded file across every live chat, and `resources/read` to
fetch content. Upload stays on the existing POST /api/uploads/* HTTP
endpoint (MCP has no upload primitive — community consensus).

Design decisions:

- URI shape: `file://uploads/{chat_id}/{url-encoded-rel-path}`. `chat_id` is
  embedded because clients don't re-send X-Chat-Id on per-resource calls
  (headers ride only on the outer request). URIs must be self-contained.
  `rel_path` is urllib.parse.quote'd because FastMCP's ResourceTemplate
  uses a per-param regex of `[^/]+` (verified at
  .venv/.../mcp/server/fastmcp/resources/templates.py:88), so nested
  paths wouldn't match `{rel}` — we flatten via percent-encoding.

- Dynamic per-chat list: FastMCP's `ResourceManager._resources` is a plain
  dict with no `remove_resource` public API. `sync_chat_resources(chat_id)`
  clears-then-re-adds under an asyncio.Lock to avoid "dict changed size
  during iteration" when resources/list is concurrent with a new upload.
  Private-API access (`mcp._resource_manager._resources.pop`) is justified
  because the alternative is a full ResourceManager subclass. `mcp`
  version is pinned in requirements.txt to guard against attribute renames.

- Called from two places:
    * docker_manager._create_container — initial sync when the chat's
      container spins up, so any already-existing uploads are visible.
    * app.py:upload_file POST handler — after a new file is saved.

Tenancy: `X-Chat-Id` is untrusted. Any caller holding MCP_API_KEY can guess
URIs and read any chat's uploads — same model as today's /api/uploads/*
endpoints. Per-chat auth is out of scope.
