"""TLS trust for the two stdlib HTTP call sites, and nothing else.

:mod:`memu.events` and :mod:`memu.hosts.templates` both reach a memU server with
``urllib`` rather than the ``httpx`` the rest of the package uses, because both
are fail-open paths that must not depend on the async stack to stay silent about
their own failures. That choice has one sharp edge, and this module is it.

``urllib`` verifies against the platform's default trust. A python.org
framework build whose bundled ``Install Certificates.command`` was never run is
pointed at *nothing* — ``ssl.get_default_verify_paths()`` reports no ``cafile``
and no ``capath``, and its default context carries no CAs — so every HTTPS call
raises ``CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED``. The second check matters on Windows, where
the same paths are empty but the default context loads the OS certificate store.
On a fail-open path that is not an error a user ever sees: events spool forever
and never deliver, templates silently fall back to their embedded copies, and the
machine looks identical to one that simply has nothing to report. ``httpx``
carries :mod:`certifi` and is unaffected, which is why ``retrieve`` keeps working
on exactly the machine where ``report flush`` delivers zero — the divergence
that made this take an afternoon to find.

**Why a fallback and not a pin.** Handing ``certifi`` to these two call sites
unconditionally would fix that machine and break the opposite one: a corporate
root CA installed OS-wide is in the system store and is *not* in ``certifi``, so
every user behind a TLS-inspecting proxy would start failing exactly as silently
as this. So the system store still wins wherever one exists, and ``certifi`` only
fills a vacuum. A machine that works today is untouched by construction —
:func:`ssl_context` returns ``None`` there, and ``None`` means "pass no context
at all", which is literally the call these sites made before.
