"""TLS trust for the two ``urllib`` call sites (:mod:`memu.trust`).

The bug this module exists for was invisible from both ends: a python.org
framework Python with no CA bundle failed verification on every ``urlopen``,
which two fail-open ``except`` clauses turned into "events never delivered" and
"templates never refresh", while the ``httpx`` paths on the same machine kept
working. So these tests are weighted toward the two directions the fix must not
go wrong in — it must fix the vacuum, and it must not touch a machine that
already has a trust store.
