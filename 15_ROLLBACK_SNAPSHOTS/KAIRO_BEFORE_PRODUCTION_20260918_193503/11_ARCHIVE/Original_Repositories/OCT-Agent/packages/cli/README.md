# @awareness.market/claw

**OCT-Agent CLI** — one-click setup for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) with persistent [Awareness](https://awareness.market) memory.

Installs OpenClaw, wires in the Awareness memory plugin, starts the local daemon, and walks you through model + channel configuration. Zero prior knowledge of Node, npm, or AI Agent tooling required.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @awareness.market/claw
```

That's it. The interactive wizard will:

1. Detect (or install) Node.js and OpenClaw
2. Install the Awareness memory plugin
3. Start the local memory daemon on `http://localhost:37800`
4. Help you pick a model provider and enter an API key
5. Optionally bind messaging channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, etc.)

### Non-interactive mode

```bash
npx @awareness.market/claw --api-key aw_xxx --memory-id <your-memory-id>
```

### Help

```bash
npx @awareness.market/claw --help
```

## What you get

- **Awareness memory** — cross-session, cross-project persistent memory with knowledge cards, task tracking, and conflict detection.
