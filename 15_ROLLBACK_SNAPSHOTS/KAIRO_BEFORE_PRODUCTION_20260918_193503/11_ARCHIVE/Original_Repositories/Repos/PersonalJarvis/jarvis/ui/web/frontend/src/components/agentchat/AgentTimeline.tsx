/**
 * The agent chat column — the person's lines in a quiet bubble on the
 * right, each assistant turn flush-left under a byline that says who
 * answered (the provider's mark, the model, the effort).
 *
 * Under the byline, in the order they happened: the model's thinking as a
 * readable scratchpad wherever it thought (a vendor that redacts its
 * thinking still gets a row, because the time is the fact), the tool calls
 * under the names the agent's own log uses, approval cards where the runner
 * asked, and the answer as Markdown.
 *
 * Three rules decide how all of that is drawn (maintainer, 2026-08-25:
 * it looks sloppy, odd boxes everywhere, and a strange stripe down the side):
 *
 * 1. ONE container per turn. Nothing inside draws a box of its own — a
 *    tool call is a row, an opened detail is a hairline and some text.
 *    Boxes inside boxes inside boxes is what made the column look busy,
 *    and a nested frame carries no information the indent does not.
 *    The turn itself is held together by its byline and the spacing; an
 *    earlier version hung it off a glowing hairline rail, which read as a
 *    stray stripe running down the transcript.
 * 2. The thinking is READ, not counted (maintainer, 2026-08-25: the
 *    intermediate steps had stopped showing). A stretch of thought that has
 *    words is a scratchpad in the place it happened: its text streams while
 *    the model writes it, stays open while the turn still works, and folds
 *    to a two-line preview once the turn is done. Only a thought with no
 *    words to show — a vendor that redacts (Claude Code) — is reduced to its
 *    time, and a running one of those draws nothing, because the live line
 *    already says the turn is thinking and two lines saying it at once is
 *    the duplication the maintainer objected to. A streaming scratchpad
 *    carries the live line in its own header for the same reason: the turn
 *    says it is working exactly ONCE.
 * 3. The turn ALWAYS says which state it is in. While it runs: the live
 *    core, a word that changes as the minutes pass, the elapsed time and
 *    the tokens spent — the Claude CLI's "Composing… (2m 35s · ↓ 3.7k
 *    tokens)", in the product's own mark and colours. The moment it stops
 *    there is a line saying so — Done, Stopped, Failed, or "finished
 *    without an answer" when a turn ends on a dead tool call. A live line
 *    that simply disappears leaves the person guessing.
 *
 * Only OUTPUT tokens are ever shown (maintainer, 2026-08-25). The input
 * side of a coding CLI re-counts the whole conversation on every step, so
 * it reads as an absurd number for one question (BUG-173); what the turn
 * produced is the honest, monotonic figure.
