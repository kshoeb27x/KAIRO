# Jarvis AI — Multi-Agent Coordination Hub
> Last updated: 2026-06-26

## How to use this file
Each AI reads this file at the start of a session, picks up its assigned tasks from the section below,
works in its own branch or directly on main, commits with a prefix tag ([CLAUDE], [CODEX], [GEMINI]),
and updates MASTER_LOG.md when done.

## Project state summary

Jarvis is a local-first macOS AI runtime (Python) with voice, TTS, STT, meetings, memory, tools,
and agentic task execution. Main entry: `main.py`. Core routing in `router.py` / `orchestrator.py`.

### What has been built (31 orchestrator rounds, P1–P8 roadmap complete)

- **P1–P3**: Intent classifier, local model routing (devstral/qwen3:30b), Ollama cloud tier
- **P4**: SQLite event bus (Redis replaced), parallel agent execution (cpu_count threads), task_runtime
- **P5**: Short-query classifier fix (~40% misroute eliminated), fix_loop/code_task routable tool
- **P6**: workspace_context snapshot injected into all orchestrate calls (git status, tree, 60s cache)
- **P7**: Circuit breakers for local model routing (google_services + specialist models)
- **P8**: Operative streaming — progress tokens stream to UI in real-time via thread+queue
- **Memory**: JSON + SQLite dual persistence, mem0 hybrid layer, cross-session memory
- **Self-eval**: Scoring loop, /reflect, /diagnose, LLM improvement notes pipeline (auto every 100)
- **Reflection**: Corrective replanning on step failure (replan_after_failure in task_planner.py)
- **Audit**: Full audit trail (query_received, route_decision, memory_write, reflection_run), hardened audit_log()
- **Silent-failure sweep**: 90+ bare exceptions converted across 13 files
- **Tests**: 130+ test files; SQLite event bus tests, P7 circuit breaker tests, workspace_context tests

### What is open / in progress

- AGENT_BOARD items 11 and 13 still open
- Final baseline suite run (lift freeze)
- audit.jsonl end-to-end verification (memory_write + route_decision)
- run_id threading through operative.py → execution_engine.py
- audit_errors.log rotation + alert threshold
- eval_trace_score surface in briefing
- GLM 5.2 eval handoff (blocked on Codex lane findings)

## Coordination rules
1. Each agent picks up only its assigned tasks from this file and the agent-specific task board.
2. Commit prefix is mandatory: `[CLAUDE]`, `[CODEX]`, or `[GEMINI]`.
3. When a task is done, update the task board file (`CODEX_TASKS.md` or `GEMINI_TASKS.md`) and append to `MASTER_LOG.md`.
4. Never touch another agent's in-progress files without announcing it here first.
5. `WORK_QUEUE.json` is the authoritative task state — update `assigned_to` when picking up a task.
6. Local-first always: Ollama/local models for routing, cloud API only when truly needed.
7. Run `python -m pytest tests/ -x -q` before committing anything that touches Python.
