        "So I updated the decision tree for those sub-categories, ran a targeted recalibration session, and the enforcement rate normalized within two weeks. "
        "The part I still carry forward is that if decisions are drifting, the signal I look for first is whether the guidance has stopped being precise enough for reviewers to apply consistently."

    "tiktok_false_positive": (
        "A strong example is a false positive spike I investigated at TikTok. "
        "The first thing I did was characterize whether the spike was broad or category-specific, because that tells you whether you are likely looking at a training problem or a classifier and policy boundary problem. "
        "It turned out to be category-specific, and when I checked timing against recent changes, the mechanism was a classifier update that had shifted the decision boundary. "
        "I built a labeled dataset of false positives and correct decisions, gave engineering concrete examples, and made the precision and recall tradeoff operational rather than abstract. "
        "That corrected the false positive rate, and I also built SQL automation so we were detecting anomalies continuously instead of waiting for a manual monthly report."

        "I did not stay in a narrow argument about engineering cost because that usually stalls the conversation. "
        "Instead, I made the tradeoff concrete across three stakeholders at once: the user who could be exposed to harm, the creator who could be hit by false positives, and the advertiser who cares about brand safety. "
        "Once the tradeoff was framed that way, the conversation got much more productive because we were deciding consciously what risk we were willing to accept instead of inheriting a default threshold. "
        "The change moved forward, and the documentation also made the decision more defensible later."
    ),
    "youtube_origin": (
        "The most relevant part of my story is that I started at YouTube doing child safety enforcement, which is where I built my enforcement instincts in the highest-stakes category I have worked in. "
        "I left because I wanted broader cross-platform exposure and the chance to build more of the quality and systems layer on top of frontline enforcement. "
        "Since then I have done exactly that across Meta, TikTok, Google Play, and AI safety operations. "
        "So when I talk about returning to a role like this, it does not feel like nostalgia. It feels like coming back with the systems depth and cross-functional judgment I did not have at the very beginning."

    "anthropic_novel_abuse": (
        "A good example from AI safety work was identifying a novel coordinated abuse pattern that did not match any existing classifier signatures. "
        "Novel patterns usually do not announce themselves clearly, so the signal I look for is anomalies across multiple sources before the behavior even has a clean label. "
        "I pulled together abuse reports, model output signals, and user behavior patterns, wrote Python tooling to cluster similar cases, and built a labeled dataset to make the pattern concrete for engineering. "
        "That let us address the behavior before it spread significantly, and the tooling became part of the longer-term monitoring workflow. "

        "I reversed a decision incorrectly, caught it quickly, and corrected it as soon as I understood what had gone wrong. "
        "Because I keep real-time notes on my reasoning during escalations, I was able to trace the exact decision point I misapplied instead of hand-waving about being under pressure. "
        "We used that in the post-mortem and found one ambiguous part of the escalation guide that was getting interpreted inconsistently, so we clarified it. "

        "I think about precision and recall as a design decision, not a natural law. "
        "In high-harm categories, false negatives matter more because missing content is worse than over-enforcement. In more borderline categories, false positives can do more damage by eroding creator trust, revenue, and system credibility. "

    ),
    "quality_measurement": (
        "I measure enforcement quality with both leading and lagging signals. "
        "The leading indicator I trust most is inter-rater reliability, because it tells me when reviewer alignment is starting to drift. "
        "The lagging indicator I care about most is appeal overturn rate, because if removals spike and overturns rise afterward, that is a strong signal the error started upstream. "

    ),
    "spike_diagnosis": (
        "My spike diagnosis framework is straightforward. "
        "First I characterize whether the spike is category-specific or broad. Category-specific usually points toward classifier behavior, guidance, or content mix. Broad usually points toward training or calibration. "
        "Then I check timing against deployments, policy changes, onboarding, and content trends. After that I look at overturns and drill into the spike day to find the actual driver. "

        "So I would be coming in with both the enforcement perspective and the systems perspective, which matters a lot for age-appropriateness because the hard part is not just making the call on one piece of content. It is building a quality system that keeps making the right call at scale."
