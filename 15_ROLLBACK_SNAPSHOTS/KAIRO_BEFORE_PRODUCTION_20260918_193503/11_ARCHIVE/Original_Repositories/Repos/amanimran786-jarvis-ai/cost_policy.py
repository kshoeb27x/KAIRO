"""
Cost-aware routing and local-model improvement policy for Jarvis.

This module turns the rough operating playbook into deterministic decisions:

1. Prefer local inference whenever quality risk is low.
2. Spend cloud tokens on harder or higher-stakes requests.
3. Distill only when failures repeat.
4. Train only when repeated failures justify the GPU spend.
