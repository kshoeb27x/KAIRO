# Project Instructions

## Branches and scope

This repository has two long-lived branches with different rules:

- **`main`** — the current PoC / production branch. Open WebUI integration, Docker Compose deployment, MCP orchestrator. The rules below apply. Quick fixes welcome.
- **`next/v1`** — the long-lived enterprise architecture branch. Same global rules apply, plus the additional architecture-work rules in the `# Architecture work on next/v1` section below. Designed for US/EU bank deployments; every architectural decision is recorded as an ADR.

When working on a feature branch, the rules of its base branch apply (e.g. `feat/foo` based on `next/v1` inherits the `next/v1` rules).

# Global rules (apply to every branch)

## Language

All code, comments, commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions, documentation, and any text visible in the repository MUST be written in **English only**. No exceptions.

## License Headers

All new source files MUST include an SPDX license header as the first comment:

- Files in `skills/public/describe-image/` or `skills/public/sub-agent/`: `# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
- Files in other `skills/` directories with their own LICENSE.txt: DO NOT add headers
- All other new files: `# SPDX-License-Identifier: FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0`

Always include: `# Copyright (c) 2025 Open Computer Use Contributors`

The FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 license permits use, modification, forking, internal self-hosting, and redistribution. It prohibits offering the Software as a hosted or embedded service that competes with our paid version(s). Each release automatically converts to Apache-2.0 two years after publication.

## Building the Docker image

Always build with `--platform linux/amd64`:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t open-computer-use:latest .
```

## Testing

After building the image or changing `Dockerfile`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, skills, or npm configuration — run:

```bash
./tests/test-docker-image.sh [image-name]
./tests/test-no-corporate.sh
./tests/test-project-structure.sh
```

Default image: `open-computer-use:latest`.

These verify: npm packages (CommonJS `require()`, ESM `import`), CLI tools (mmdc, tsc, tsx, claude), Python packages, Playwright, html2pptx, volume size (`/home/assistant/` < 1MB), file permissions, project structure, no corporate references.

## npm packages layout

Packages are installed outside `/home/assistant` (volume mount point) to avoid duplication per container:

| Path | Contents | Storage |
|------|----------|---------|
| `/home/node_modules/` | Libraries (react, pptxgenjs, pdf-lib...) | Image layer (shared) |
| `/usr/local/lib/node_modules_global/` | CLI tools (mmdc, tsc, tsx, claude) | Image layer (shared) |
| `/home/assistant/node_modules/` | User-installed packages (`npm install`) | Volume (per-container) |

Node.js uses parent-directory resolution: if a package isn't found in `/home/assistant/node_modules`, it looks in `/home/node_modules`.

## Project structure

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile` | Sandbox container image (Ubuntu 24.04, Python, Node.js, CDP, ttyd) |
| `computer-use-server/` | MCP orchestrator (FastAPI, Docker management, CDP/terminal proxy) |
| `openwebui/` | Open WebUI integration (tools, functions, patches) |
| `settings-wrapper/` | Settings sidecar service |
| `skills/` | AI skills (pptx, xlsx, docx, pdf, sub-agent, playwright-cli, ...) |
| `helm/` | Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment |
| `vendor/` | Vendored third-party binaries (e.g. `extract-text`) |
| `tests/` | Test scripts |
| `docs/` | Project documentation |
| `docs/architecture/` | Canonical enterprise architecture (`next/v1` only); read `MANIFESTO.md` first |
| `docs/future-architecture/` | In-progress architecture buffer; superseded by `docs/architecture/` over time |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Computer Use Server |
| `docker-compose.webui.yml` | Open WebUI + PostgreSQL (connects to server via `host.docker.internal`) |

## Versioning (current `main`-line scheme)

Format: `v0.11.X.Y` — the first three segments (`0.11.X`) track the **Open WebUI** base version this project is built on. Never bump them independently.

- **Patch release** (`Y+1`): bug fixes, security patches, dependency bumps, test additions → e.g. `v0.11.0.0` → `v0.11.0.1`
- **Minor release** (`X+1`, reset `Y=0`): new features, new tools, significant changes → only when Open WebUI base version also bumps

To release:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version heading.
2. Commit: `chore: release vX.X.X.X`.
3. Tag: `git tag vX.X.X.X && git push origin main --tags`.

If the environment cannot push a tag — Claude Code on the web restricts git pushes to the working branch — run the **Release** workflow manually instead (`gh workflow run release.yml -f version=vX.X.X.X`, or the Actions tab). It validates the version, refuses to tag a version with no `CHANGELOG.md` heading, creates the tag, cuts the GitHub Release, and dispatches the image build and chart publish. `supply-chain.yml` (SBOM + cosign signing) stays manual either way: it signs as the project's Sigstore identity and requires `production`-environment approval.

The `next/v1` branch will define its own versioning scheme in an ADR; until then it carries no tagged releases.

# Architecture work on `next/v1`

The sections below apply to all architectural work on the `next/v1` branch (the long-lived enterprise architecture branch). They do not constrain quick fixes or PoC work on `main`.

## Architecture decisions (next/v1)

Before proposing, designing, or implementing anything architectural on `next/v1` — read [`docs/architecture/MANIFESTO.md`](./docs/architecture/MANIFESTO.md). The Manifesto sets the non-negotiables (enterprise compliance posture, build-vs-buy rules, starter-mode limitations, licensing). Any deviation requires a new ADR under [`docs/architecture/adr/`](./docs/architecture/adr/) that explicitly cites the principle being overridden and why.

Component-level work: read the relevant ADRs under [`docs/architecture/adr/`](./docs/architecture/adr/) before editing the component's spec or code. Use [`docs/architecture/PROCESS.md`](./docs/architecture/PROCESS.md) when adding new components, ADRs, NFRs, dependencies, or TBD-stubs.

## Architecture content routing

Before writing any new architectural content, walk this tree. If you cannot place a paragraph in 30 seconds using these steps, the paragraph is not yet a decision — leave it as an Open Question (step 6), not as prose.

1. **Is it a non-negotiable rule that every future decision must respect?** → `MANIFESTO.md` §03 (Principles). Add anti-example. One line for rationale. No implementation detail. STOP.
2. **Else, is it a measurable cross-cutting requirement (latency, RTO, isolation, audit retention)?** → `manifesto/02-nfrs.md` as a scenario with a measurable target. STOP.
3. **Else, is it a load-bearing decision that (a) is hard to reverse, OR (b) crosses ≥ 2 components, OR (c) closes a debated option?** → New ADR in `adr/NNNN-slug.md` with Status / Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives. Link from every affected component spec. STOP.
4. **Else, is it an internal design detail of exactly one existing component?** → That component's spec under `components/<NN>-<name>.md`. Inside the fixed section order. STOP.
5. **Else, is it a term used in ≥ 2 documents (or one ambiguous term)?** → `glossary.md`. Inline use links to the glossary entry. STOP.
6. **Else, is it a question we cannot yet answer?** → `## Open questions` section of the nearest owning doc, capped at 5 entries; each entry MUST link a GitHub issue. If the cap is exceeded, escalate the oldest to an ADR or close it. STOP.
7. **Else, is it content lifted from `docs/future-architecture/` that is still valid?** → Re-evaluate, then rewrite in the target location (steps 1-5) with `supersedes: docs/future-architecture/<file>` in front-matter. Leave a redirect stub in the original. STOP.
8. **Else, is it speculation about something we may build later?** → DO NOT WRITE prose. Create a `tbd` stub: a single line + tracking issue. STOP.
9. **Else, is it a how-to / runbook?** → `docs/operating/` only; never inside architecture docs. STOP.
10. **Else** → it does not belong in the architecture set. Reject or route to README / CHANGELOG.

## Diagrams

- **Mermaid first.** All diagrams under `docs/architecture/` are Mermaid source files (`.mmd`) committed alongside the doc that references them. Inline mermaid blocks allowed only for diagrams ≤ 15 lines.
- **D2 or PlantUML** only when Mermaid lacks the primitive (e.g. complex sequence with timing constraints).
- **ASCII diagrams are forbidden** in `docs/architecture/`. They don't render in browsers, can't be linted for broken references, and signal AI-style ad-hoc artwork. Existing ASCII art in `docs/future-architecture/` is converted to Mermaid during migration, not lifted.
- **PNG / JPG / SVG** only for: external-UI screenshots, customer-supplied branding, scanned analog artifacts. Never for our own diagrams (we lose versionability and diff-ability).
- **C4 model levels:** Context → Container → Component. Code-level diagrams (level 4) only when needed, normally inside the relevant component spec or ADR.
- **Trust-zone diagrams** live in a single canonical place; other docs link to it.

## Dependency policy

For every dependency added to the project (build, runtime, or dev):

1. **License gate.** Must be: Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-2/3, MPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1 (as separate service), PostgreSQL. Reject: AGPL (any), BSL, BUSL (other than past-version of our own), SSPL, CC-NC, commercial-only-source.
2. **Supply-chain gate.** Must have: SBOM published OR reproducible build OR signed releases OR cosign-attested artifacts. Reject: sole-maintainer npm/PyPI packages with no provenance.
3. **Bundled vs not-bundled.** Recorded in the Bill of Materials in `manifesto/05-licensing-posture.md`:
   - **Bundled** = we ship the binary/image/lib as part of our release. Carries full responsibility: vuln-scanning, version pinning, CVE response.
   - **Not bundled** = customer provides via standard API (Keycloak, OpenBao, Splunk, customer KMS). We document the integration contract; customer owns the lifecycle.
4. **Enterprise-grade requirement.** When in doubt between a heavier, vendor-backed, audited tool and a lighter, sole-maintainer one — pick the heavier. The platform targets regulated enterprises; lightweight-but-undocumented loses every InfoSec review.
5. **Reject reasons are first-class.** If we reject something, record it in the rejection table in `manifesto/05-licensing-posture.md` so future contributors don't re-propose it.

## Testing & QA discipline (next/v1)

Foundation rule: every gate ships in the Layer 0 commits of `next/v1`, before any architectural content. "We'll add tests later" never happens at this stage.

Top three CI gates a regulated-enterprise auditor opens first — without these the repo is not auditable at all:

1. **Secrets scan blocks merge.** gitleaks + trufflehog on every commit + pre-receive hook. Any hit = red.
2. **SAST/SCA CRITICAL blocks merge.** Semgrep + CodeQL HIGH/CRITICAL on changed files; Trivy/Grype CRITICAL on deps and container images. HIGH allowed for 14 days with a tracked exception file.
3. **Signed SBOM + SLSA L3 provenance** required for every release artifact. Syft → SPDX, Cosign-signed; CI fails if missing.

Full CI rule set (lands in the CI-gates PR of Layer 0): IaC scan (Checkov + tfsec), Cosign signature verification on dep pulls, license scan against the allow-list in `manifesto/05-licensing-posture.md`, unit-test patch coverage ≥ 80%, mutation testing ≥ 60% on auth/sandbox/audit/broker packages, property-based tests on every parser/scheduler/policy engine, k6 perf regression < 10%, Playwright golden-path E2E on every merge, Promptfoo red-team subset per PR (Garak + PyRIT nightly), Threagile threat-model re-runs on DFD-bearing PRs, conventional commits, signed commits, CODEOWNERS approval, branch-protection bypass = block.

Documentation linter (same CI): markdownlint, vale (banned vocab + phrases), lychee (broken links), wc-line-budget (ADR ≤ 200, component spec ≤ 600, MANIFESTO ≤ 400, README sections ≤ one screen), ai-slop-detector (banned phrases and AI tells), front-matter validator (`status`, `last-reviewed`, `owner`, `applies-to` mandatory), staleness warning (`last-reviewed` > 180 days), ASCII-diagram detector in `docs/architecture/`.

Code-review discipline: CODEOWNERS routes every PR; "done definition" per PR includes tests added/updated, docs updated in the same PR, CHANGELOG entry, status front-matter updated, ADR linked if decision-bearing. Reviewers run the content-routing tree above on every architecture doc.

## v1 non-goals (locked early)

The following are explicit non-goals for `next/v1` GA. Each gets a clean abstraction boundary so the contract is ready when we add them later, but the implementation is out of scope:

- **Skill registry.** v1 ships zero default skills bundled. Components include a `SkillProvider` abstraction at `status: tbd`. Skills load from an external registry the customer provides. Anti-pattern: invent a half-baked skill format now and lock customers into it.
- **Hosted models and the agent loop.** OCU does not host, select, or proxy an LLM, and does not run the agent loop. OCU is an MCP server plus a sandbox executor; the loop and the model choice live in the calling client (a Wide-Moat sibling component such as LiteLLM / Open WebUI / n8n, or any MCP caller). If a sandbox tool needs an LLM, it reaches it as one allow-listed egress endpoint, governed by the same Egress trust-edge, broker, and audit path as any other endpoint — not through an OCU model abstraction.
- **Admin web UI.** v1 ships zero admin UI. CLI (`occ`) + GitOps + Grafana for ops. Every UI is new attack surface, auth burden, and accessibility cost. v2 may add a read-only operator console after CLI is feature-complete and customers request it.
- **SaaS offered by us.** Our license (FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0) forbids competing hosted services without permission. We ship self-hostable software only.

## Documentation discipline (applies to all docs)

Applies to every file under `docs/`, every `README.md`, every ADR.

- Front-matter required: `status`, `last-reviewed` (YYYY-MM-DD), `owner`, `applies-to`. CI fails without all four.
- First line after front-matter: one sentence stating purpose and audience. No preamble.
- Diátaxis (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation) governs `docs/getting-started/`, `docs/operating/`, `docs/contributing/`. It does NOT govern `docs/architecture/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/compliance/` — those are engineering artifacts with their own templates.
- ADR: Nygard format (Context / Decision / Consequences / Alternatives / Status). One decision per file. Present tense ("We will…"). Hard cap 200 lines.
- Component spec: fixed sections in order — Purpose, Boundaries, Invariants, Failure modes, Operational concerns, Open questions. Hard cap 600 lines.
- MANIFESTO: principles only. Each principle gets one rationale line and one anti-example. Hard cap 400 lines. No implementation details — they live in component specs.
- Compliance mapping: table only (control → component → evidence link). No narrative.
- Show before tell: every concept doc has a runnable example, command, or diagram above the first prose explanation. ADRs exempt.
- Why over what: prose explains rationale and trade-offs. The code shows the what. If a paragraph paraphrases the code, delete it.
- One source of truth: each fact lives in one file; others link. Glossary terms defined only in `docs/architecture/glossary.md`.
- Diagrams as source (Mermaid / PlantUML). No `.png` in `docs/architecture/` except external-UI screenshots.
- No forward references. Don't link to docs that don't exist. Don't write "covered later." If it belongs here, write it; otherwise drop it.
- No TOC in docs ≤ 500 lines. No Conclusion / Summary section in docs < 1000 lines. Headings already navigate.
- One outbound link cap: ≤ 3 cross-doc links per H2 section. More links = the doc is fragmented; consolidate.
- Tables when ≥ 3 parallel items have ≥ 2 attributes. Lists for sequences only. Prose for argument.
- Banned vocabulary: "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "powerful", "best-in-class", "industry-leading", "modern", "elegant", "battle-tested". State the specific property instead (e.g. "supports transactional DDL", not "robust").
- Banned phrases: "It's worth noting that…", "It is important to…", "In this section…", "This document will…", "Going forward…", "Please note…", "Happy coding", "delve".
- No restating project scope. Reader arrived via README; assume context. No file begins with "open-computer-use is…".
- No stub headings. Write the content or remove the heading.
- No marketing tone. State requirements, constraints, trade-offs, and decisions. No adjectives without a measurable referent.
- Examples beat lists of features. If a feature list is necessary, every item must link to where it's specified or demonstrated.
- Docs and code change in the same PR. CODEOWNERS routes doc review by `applies-to`. Drifted docs (last-reviewed > 180 days) flagged in CI.
- Step-by-step copy-paste for user-facing procedures: "do this, then this, verify". No scattered KNOWN-BUGS-style fragments.
- English only. No emoji unless the user explicitly requests it.
- When in doubt, delete. Shorter is better if no fact is lost.

### Slop patterns (structural, not just vocabulary)

The banned-vocabulary list catches words. These catch the structure that reads as AI-generated even when every word is clean. Reviewers and the doc-slop agent (`.claude/agents/doc-slop-reviewer.md`) check these on every new architecture doc.

- **Headings name content, never frame it.** A heading states what the section *is*, as a noun phrase. Never "Why this is not X", "Understanding Y", "A note on Z", "How we think about W". These are conversational tells.
  - Bad: `## Why this layer is not the trust-zone layer` → Good: `## Context vs trust zone`
  - Bad: `## Understanding the broker` → Good: `## Credential broker`
- **The purpose line states purpose once.** The mandated first sentence says what the doc is and for whom — once. Do not follow it with a second sentence that restates the audience in other words.
  - Bad: "Cuts the domain into contexts … the call made before any component exists. Audience is anyone deciding what we build vs integrate." (the tail restates the opening)
  - Good: "Cuts the domain into bounded contexts and classifies each — the buy-vs-build call. Audience: anyone choosing what to build and what to integrate."
- **No throat-clearing tails.** Drop "… before any component exists", "… in the modern landscape", "… as we move forward" — grand-sounding clauses that add no fact.
- **No hedge-restatement.** Don't say a thing, then say it again softer: "X. That is to say, X." Cut the second clause.
- **No rule-of-three padding.** "secure, scalable, and resilient" — adjective triples without a measurable referent are the loudest tell. Name one specific property or none.
- **No "it's important to note / worth mentioning" even reworded.** If it's important, state it as a plain claim. If it isn't, cut it.
- **Symmetry for its own sake is a smell.** Every section the same length, every list exactly three items, every paragraph the same shape — real docs are lumpy because content is lumpy. Don't pad a thin section to match a thick one.
- **No process-narration.** The doc, the commit message, and the PR description record what is true, never how you arrived at it. State the resulting fact, never the research path that led to it. Banned: "We researched / dug into / investigated and found …", "After analysing …, we decided …", "established this session" — and, above all, any clause that names where a fact came from. The reader does not care how the conclusion was reached. Bad: "After studying the design, then fixing our Layer 3." Good: "The control channel stays off the guest network; the host dials in."
- **No view-restatement.** A fact that already lives in a table, a diagram label, or another section is stated once. Prose next to a table adds only what the table can't carry — never "as the table shows" followed by the table's content. A diagram labels; it does not explain — push the "why" to the section, not the node.
