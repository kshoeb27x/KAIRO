MIRA is a single binary, `mira`. Run it with no arguments to start the
interactive TUI; pass a subcommand to set up, install, control, or upgrade the
service. This page lists the user-facing commands and their common flags.

```
mira [GLOBAL OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]
```

Run `mira --help`, or `mira <subcommand> --help`, for the authoritative,
version-matched listing on your machine.

## Running modes

With **no subcommand**, `mira` picks a run mode from flags on the top-level
command:

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mira` | Start the rich interactive TUI. |
| `mira --simple` | Use the simple line-based CLI instead of the TUI. |
| `mira --server` | Run in server mode — hosts the web/HTTP API and channel pollers. This is the mode the installed service runs. |
| `mira --local` | Force the TUI to talk directly to the agent (no server). |
| `mira --server-url <URL>` | Point the TUI at a running MIRA HTTP server. Uses `MIRA_TOKEN` as the bearer token if set. Mutually exclusive with `--local`. |

Useful flags in these modes:

- `--port <PORT>` / `--host <ADDR>` — override the configured bind. Use
  `--host 0.0.0.0` to expose the API on all interfaces (for example, inside a
  port-forwarding container).
- `--layout <MODE>` / `--theme <NAME>` — override the TUI layout
  (`simple`/`standard`/`right-full`/…) or colour theme
  (`mira-dark`/`mira-light`/`dracula`/`gruvbox`/`nord`).

## Global options

These apply to any invocation, including subcommands:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--config <PATH>` | Use a specific config file. Default: `~/.mira/config/mira_config.json`. |
| `--data-dir <PATH>` | Override the data directory (databases, history, memory, auth, wiki, artifacts). Wins over the `data_dir` config field; equivalent to setting `MIRA_DATA_DIR`. Accepted on any subcommand. |
| `--print-config-template` | Print the annotated example config and exit. |
| `--help`, `--version` | Standard help / version output. |

> Put your data on a backed-up volume by choosing it during `mira setup`, or pass
> `--data-dir` (and let `mira install` bake it into the service). See
> [Back up & restore](../guides/backup-and-restore.md).

## Setup & installation

### `mira setup`

Guided first-run wizard. Configures an admin account, an LLM provider (validated
live), and the network/security posture, then writes a validated config. Voice
and channels are finished afterwards in the web UI.

Common flags:

- `--unattended` — run non-interactively (Docker/CI/scripts), taking answers from
  flags and environment.
- `--force` — reconfigure even if a config already exists.
- `--provider <ID>` — `ollama` | `lmstudio` | `anthropic` | `openai` |
  `openrouter` | `gemini` | `deepseek` | `groq` | `xai`.
- `--api-key <KEY>` / `--base-url <URL>` / `--model <NAME>` — provider details.
- `--admin-user <NAME>` / `--admin-pass <PASS>` — the bootstrap admin account.
- `--bind <localhost|lan>` — bind locally (default) or on all interfaces.
- `--port <PORT>` — the server port.
- `--skip-provider-test` — skip the live provider connection check.

See [Installation](../getting-started/installation.md) and the
[Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

### `mira install`

Register MIRA as a service so the OS supervises it. By default this installs a
**user-scope** `systemd --user` unit (`~/.config/systemd/user/`).

Common flags:

- `--system` — install **system-scope** instead
  (`/etc/systemd/system/mira.service`): creates a `mira` system user and runs on
  boot regardless of who's logged in. Requires `sudo`. Use for VPS / shared-host
  deployments where the service must survive logout.
- `--config <PATH>` — the config the service should load.
- `--working-dir <PATH>` — the service working directory (default `$HOME`).
- `--web-dir <PATH>` — path to the built web bundle (`web/dist/`); auto-detected
  if omitted.
- `--no-enable` — write the unit file but don't enable/start it.
- `--force` — overwrite an existing unit without prompting.

### Service control

Once installed, control the service without touching `systemctl` directly:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mira start` | Start the service. |
| `mira stop` | Stop the service. |
| `mira restart` | Restart the service (same as clicking Restart in the web UI). |
| `mira status` | Show the service's systemd status and recent journal. |
| `mira uninstall` | Disable and remove the service unit. |

### `mira reset-admin-password`

Locked out? Reset a local account's password from the command line — the recovery
path when the admin password is lost:

```
mira reset-admin-password            # resets the built-in "admin" account
mira reset-admin-password --user sam # reset a specific account
```

It prompts for the new password (minimum **12 characters** — a passphrase is
ideal), writes it, and revokes any existing sessions so the old credential can't
linger. Run it on the host as the operator (it needs filesystem access to the
data directory); pass `--data-dir`/`--config` if MIRA uses a non-default location.

## Upgrading

### `mira upgrade`

Update MIRA to a newer version. By default it **rebuilds from source** when a
MIRA source checkout is reachable (dev installs); otherwise it downloads and
**verifies a signed prebuilt tarball** (binary installs) against MIRA's embedded
public key before swapping the binary in. Pass `--source` or `--binary` to force
a path.

Common flags:

- `--source` / `--binary` — force the rebuild or the signed-download path
  (mutually exclusive).
- `--branch <NAME>` — *(source)* switch to a branch before pulling.
- `--version <VERSION>` — *(binary)* install a specific version (e.g. `0.84.0`);
  defaults to the latest release.
- `--no-restart` — install the new binary but don't restart the service.
- `--force` — *(source)* allow upgrading with uncommitted changes; *(binary)*
  re-install the same version (repair).

### `mira rollback`

Roll back to the binary **and** config snapshot saved before the last upgrade
(snapshots are created automatically on every `mira upgrade`). Works even if the
current build **crash-loops** — run it from an admin terminal to recover.

Common flags:

- `--list` — list the available rollback snapshots and exit.
- `--version <VERSION>` — roll back to a specific version (e.g. `0.292.3`);
  defaults to the most recent snapshot.
- `--no-restart` — restore the binary + config but don't restart the service.

See [Updating & rolling back](../guides/updating-and-rolling-back.md).

## Benchmarking

### `mira bench memory`

Run MIRA's memory stack against the **LongMemEval** long-term-memory benchmark.
It replays each conversation through MIRA's real extraction pipeline, asks the
question through the normal turn path (real memory + wiki retrieval), and
LLM-judges the answer against the gold, reporting per-question-type and overall
accuracy.

The dataset isn't bundled (it isn't redistributable) — download a LongMemEval
JSON (e.g. `longmemeval_s.json`) and point `--dataset` at it.

Common flags:

- `--dataset <PATH>` — **required** path to the LongMemEval JSON.
- `--dry-run` — print only the dataset summary (counts per type); no API spend.
- `--limit <N>` — cap the number of questions for a smoke run (default 20).
- `--all` — run the full dataset (ignores `--limit`).
- `--question-type <TYPE>` — only run one category (e.g. `single-session-user`,
  `temporal-reasoning`); the dataset is grouped by type.
- `--answer-provider <ID>` / `--judge-provider <ID>` — provider ids (from config)
  used to answer and to judge. Default: the configured primary.
- `--model <MODEL>` — override the chosen provider's model for the run (applies
  to answer + judge).
- `--extract-model <MODEL>` — pin the extraction model independently of
  `--model`, to isolate retrieval quality from answer-model capability.
- `--out <PATH>` — also write a JSON report to this path.

Examples:

```bash
# Inspect the dataset only, no API spend
mira bench memory --dataset ./longmemeval_s.json --dry-run

# Smoke run (default 20 questions)
mira bench memory --dataset ./longmemeval_s.json

# Full run with a JSON report
mira bench memory --dataset ./longmemeval_s.json --all --out results.json
```

See [Memory & the wiki](../concepts/memory-and-wiki.md) for what's being
measured.

### `mira bench context`

A local, no-API-spend estimator for context-window utilisation: it projects
tokens, context-window usage %, and turns dropped across a range of conversation
lengths. Flags: `--turns <N,N,…>` (default `10,40,100,300`), `--avg-msg-chars`,
`--context-length`, `--system-tokens`, `--max-response-tokens`, `--safety-margin`,
and `--out <PATH>` for a CSV report. A measurement tool for tuning
`agent.context_length_tokens` / compaction — no model calls.

## Other commands

A handful of narrower subcommands round out the CLI:

- **`mira tts`** — voice tooling: `probe` a backend, list `voices`, download a
  Piper voice (`download-voice`), synthesise to a file (`say`), inspect/clear the
  audio `cache`, or run an MCP `mcp-serve` voice server. See
  [Voice replies](../guides/voice-replies.md).
- **`mira sandbox`** — manage the Linux code-execution sandbox rootfs: `probe`,
  `status`, `install <language>`, `uninstall <language>`.
- **`mira deps`** — manage MIRA's bundled native dependencies (currently the ONNX
  Runtime used for in-process embeddings): `install`, `verify`, `list`.
- **`mira skill`** — Skill-author tools: `init`, `validate`, `keygen`, `sign`,
  `package`, plus a `secret` store and `refresh-bundled`.
- **`mira wiki`** — wiki tooling: `mcp-serve --user-id <ID>` exposes a user's
  wiki over MCP (for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients); `rebuild-profile`
  regenerates a wiki `profile.md` from onboarding state.
- **`mira helper-install`** — install MIRA's least-privilege **privileged
  helper** as a root systemd service (run as `sudo mira helper-install`). The
  helper enables native-tier plugin **egress filtering**; without it, a native
  plugin that declares an egress allowlist runs with no network at all.
  `mira helper-status` probes the running helper.
- **`mira guardian-install`** — install the out-of-process **Guardian liveness
  sentinel** as its own supervised unit (`mira-guardian-watch.service`), separate
  from the main service so it outlives a server crash. Run after enabling
  `guardian.process.enabled` in **Settings → Guardian**. Flags: `--config <PATH>`,
  `--working-dir <PATH>`, `--no-enable`, `--system` (system-scope, needs sudo).
  `mira guardian-uninstall` removes the unit. Linux/systemd today.
- **`mira wsl-host-alias-install`** — *(WSL2, root)* add a `windows-host` hosts
  alias so MIRA can reach services on the Windows host when the LAN IP isn't
  routable. `--alias <NAME>` overrides the name. Usually run for you by
  `mira helper-install`; run `sudo mira wsl-host-alias-install` to do it directly.

## Internal commands

MIRA inserts a few **internal wrapper commands** when it launches confined plugin
processes and elevated operations — for example `pkg-exec`, `ctr-run`, and the
`helper-*` daemon internals. These are not meant to be run by hand (most are
hidden from `--help`); MIRA manages them for you. Treat any subcommand not listed
above as internal.
