# Awesome Personal AI Assistants [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of open-source personal AI assistants you run on your own devices.

These are always-on, self-hosted AI agents that connect to your existing chat channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, etc.), remember context across conversations, and act on your behalf. They use LLMs as their reasoning engine but run locally under your control.
