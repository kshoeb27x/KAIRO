## Your first PR in five steps

1. **Fork and clone**, then install:
   ```bash
   pip install -e . --no-deps && pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
2. **Pick something.** A [good first issue](https://github.com/PersonalJarvis/PersonalJarvis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), or simply the thing that annoyed you.
3. **Change one thing** and run `pytest -m "not slow"` (UI work: `npm run test` in `jarvis/ui/web/frontend/`).
4. **Open the PR.** The template has one short block per kind of change — tick yours, skip the rest. A typo fix owes nothing else.
5. **Stuck?** Ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/x7USduHxbc). Someone usually answers the same day.

That's it. You don't need to read the rest of this page to open a PR, and you don't need to
understand the whole system to fix one piece of it.

> [!TIP]
> **A first PR doesn't have to be perfect.** If CI fails on a rule you've never heard of,
> that's normal and not a rejection — say so in the PR and we'll walk you through it.

## Two things worth knowing

- **We write in English.** Code, comments, docs, commit messages and PR text are English so
  that everyone can read them. Talk to us in any language you like — the repo itself stays
  English, and CI checks that for you so you don't have to think about it.
- **Keep each PR to one change.** Small PRs get reviewed fast and merged fast.

## What we'd love help with

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bug fixes** | Always first. Crashes, wrong behaviour, lost data, anything that made the voice path worse. |
| **Cross-platform work** | Linux, macOS, Windows and headless servers are equal here. Making something work on a platform it didn't before is a great contribution. |
| **Security hardening** | Prompt injection, the line between what the user said and what a tool observed, path traversal. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). |
| **Speed and robustness** | Voice latency, retries, honest degradation, the rule that a conversation never blocks. |
| **New providers and plugins** | Across all seven groups (wake, STT, TTS, brain, harness, tool, channel). Provider-agnostic, passing the contract suite. |
| **Docs** | Any time. Unclear sentence, missing step, outdated screenshot — fix it. |

> [!TIP]
> Planning something bigger than a fix? Open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
> It keeps you from writing a PR that was never going to land.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PersonalJarvis/PersonalJarvis ~/personal-jarvis
cd ~/personal-jarvis

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -e . --no-deps            # activates the plugin entry-points
pip install -r requirements.txt       # runtime dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"               # pytest, ruff, mypy

python -m jarvis --wizard             # interactive first-run setup
python -m jarvis.ui.web.launcher      # run it (add --headless for a server)
```

Frontend: `npm install` in `jarvis/ui/web/frontend/`, then `npm run dev` / `npm run build` /
`npm run test`.

> [!NOTE]
> After editing entry-points in `pyproject.toml`, re-run `pip install -e . --no-deps`. That is
> what activates new plugins, and skipping it is the #1 reason a plugin "does not exist".

### Running the checks

```bash
pytest -m "not slow"          # fast subset — enough for most PRs
pytest tests/                 # full suite
pytest tests/contract/ -v     # for new STT/Brain/Tool/Channel providers

ruff check jarvis/ && ruff format --check jarvis/
mypy jarvis/

cd jarvis/ui/web/frontend && npm run test && npm run build
```

Tests use fakes from `tests/fakes/`, not mocks.

## Before you open the PR

The PR template scales with what you touched. Find your row, ignore the rest:

| Your change | What it owes |
|---|---|
| Docs, comments, translations | Nothing beyond English |
| Web UI | `npm run test` + `npm run build`, works in light **and** dark mode, a screenshot. Don't commit `jarvis/ui/web/dist/` — the maintainer rebuilds the bundle |
| Bug fix, ordinary Python | `pytest -m "not slow"` green, a test for the fixed behaviour, `ruff` clean |
| New provider | The above plus `pytest tests/contract/`, no `import jarvis.*` in the module, honest degradation without a key |
| A shared contract (capability, config schema, turn-taking, credentials, OS backend) | The above plus: which platforms you touched and what the others do now, a boot on headless `python:3.11-slim`, `CHANGELOG.md` |

Unsure which row you're in? Open the PR and ask. We'd rather tell you in review than have
you guess high and waste an evening.

## Going deeper

Reference for when you want it. None of this is required for a first PR.

<details>
<summary><b>The architecture in four rules</b></summary>

<br />

Personal Jarvis is an 8-layer system. Four rules matter before you write anything:

1. **Layers talk through protocols.** Higher layers reach lower ones only through
   `jarvis/core/protocols.py`. Anything sideways goes over the EventBus as a typed,
   immutable event.
2. **Everything streams.** `Brain`, `STT`, `TTS` and `Harness` methods return an
   `AsyncIterator`; a provider that cannot stream yields exactly one element.
3. **No vendor is load-bearing.** Never hardcode one brain provider; `cfg.brain.primary`
   decides.
4. **The router dispatches rather than doing.** Heavy work becomes a mission in an isolated
   `git worktree`, under a worker-and-critic loop.

For the deep version read [`docs/LLM-CONTEXT.md`](docs/LLM-CONTEXT.md) (a dense
engineering snapshot) and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (the binding conventions, including the
cross-platform doctrine in section 2).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Plugin, tool, or skill?</b></summary>

<br />

The most common design question. Pick the smallest thing that fits:

| | Plugin | Tool | Skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | A swappable provider | A brain-callable action inside one turn | An authored, multi-step workflow |
| Where it lives | `jarvis/plugins/<group>/`, one of 7 groups | Registered tool, run via `ToolExecutor` | Authored skill; generated ones start as `draft` |
| The one rule | No `import jarvis.*` in the module; new STT/Brain/Tool/Channel must pass `tests/contract/` | Never call `Tool.execute()` directly | Never auto-activated |

A swappable backend is a plugin. A single action the brain can call is a tool. A multi-step
workflow somebody wrote down is a skill.

**Marketplace plugins** (the connectors in the app's Plugins store — GitHub, Notion, Slack, …)
are a separate, fourth thing. New submissions are packaged per the vendor-neutral
[Agent Plugins standard v1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/): a directory with a
`plugin.json`, an `mcp.json` when the service has an MCP server, and everything
Jarvis-specific under the `io.github.personaljarvis` extension namespace. Field mapping and
the migration tracker: [`docs/marketplace/agent-plugins-standard.md`](docs/marketplace/agent-plugins-standard.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Adding a TTS provider: four registrations, not one</b></summary>

<br />

The entry point in `pyproject.toml` makes a TTS provider discoverable, but the config path
builds providers through `_build_provider()` in
[`jarvis/plugins/tts/__init__.py`](jarvis/plugins/tts/__init__.py) — that is where each
family's own voice, model and sub-table handling lives, and where leftover values from a
previous provider get scrubbed. A provider with an entry point but no branch there hits the
`Unknown TTS provider` fallback: Gemini speaks instead of you, with only a log line to say so.

The four places:

1. The entry point in `pyproject.toml`.
2. A branch in `_build_provider()`.
3. An alias set wired into `_canonical_tts_name()`, so every spelling of your provider
   resolves to one family.
4. An entry in `_TTS_SECRET_CANDIDATES` if it needs a key — without it the credential gate
   treats the provider as always available.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Conventions CI enforces</b></summary>

<br />

You'll find out either way; better to know first:

| Area | The rule |
|---|---|
| Language | English artifacts only (`language-policy` gate) |
| Risk tier | `ToolExecutor.execute()` is the only authorized execution path |
| Router | `ROUTER_TOOLS` is a frozenset; no spawn tool in a worker tool set |
| Enum drift | Strings crossing module boundaries use the five-layer pattern plus a parity test |
| Config writes | Mutate `jarvis.toml` only via `config_writer` (lock, tempfile, BOM-safe) |
| Subprocess | Always pass `NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS` |
| Secrets | Only via `get_secret()`; never in code, config, or commits |
| Dependencies | No Windows-only or GPU-only dependency in the base install; extras only |

The full anti-pattern register lives in [`docs/LLM-CONTEXT.md`](docs/LLM-CONTEXT.md).
