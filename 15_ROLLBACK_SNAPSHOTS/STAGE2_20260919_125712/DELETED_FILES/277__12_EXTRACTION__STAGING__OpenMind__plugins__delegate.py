Delegate plugin -- planner-autonomy wrapper around run_subagent (ADR-0020 S4,
Issue #730).

HITL slice: this is the first time the planner itself is handed a `delegate`
tool. Every earlier slice (S1-S3) was caller-invoked only (ADR-0020 decision
3) -- a hand-picked internal flow called run_subagent directly. This plugin
crosses that line: any turn the planner is choosing tools for can now decide
on its own to spin off a sub-agent. That is exactly the "new autonomous
capability" category that requires human review before merge (see
DELEGATION-BUILD.md's HITL marking on this slice).

REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES -- declared as `frozenset()`. This plugin performs no
capability-bearing primitive itself: `_delegate` reads its own args, then
awaits `run_subagent`, which awaits the CALLER's own `gate_fn`/`execute_fn`
for every nested tool it runs (ADR-0020 decision 7 -- "same orchestrator +
gate + ACL for every nested step"). The security boundary is that per-step
re-gating, not a declaration on this wrapper -- there is nothing here for a
gate to check. `plugins/memory.py` (Issue #79) is the established precedent
for this shape: "First plugin to declare REQUIRED_CAPABILITIES =
frozenset(). The plugin source contains no AST-completeness-tracked
primitives... The orchestrator validator at cerebral/mcp/orchestrator.py:50
explicitly names this as a supported case." It also matches the posture
`cerebral.main._gate_tool` already takes for `recipe_*` synthetic tools:
SILENT at the wrapper, because per-step gates fire inside the replay.
(An earlier draft of this file declared the full 16-class vocabulary
instead, reasoning that a meta-tool should honestly advertise its reach.
That declaration made `delegate` DENY-by-default on any profile without an
explicit `shell_exec` grant -- `DEFAULT_POLICY[SHELL_EXEC] = Decision.DENY`
and `MCPOrchestrator.check_capabilities` takes the worst decision across the
declared set -- which silently killed the tool. `frozenset()` is correct,
not just simpler.)

No-nesting: `run_subagent` already strips `delegate` out of a sub-agent's
own tool set (ADR-0020 decision 9, cerebral/llm/subagent.py) -- this plugin
does not re-implement that guard, only relies on it. Never add "delegate" to
a `tools=[...]` scoping list passed into a sub-run.

Wiring seam: this module must never `import cerebral.main` -- plugins are
loaded by the orchestrator via spec_from_file_location as
`openmind_plugin_delegate`, a SEPARATE module instance from anything
`import plugins.delegate` would get (Issue #153). Instead it exposes
`set_subagent_context(context_fn)`, a single module-level setter matching
the `set_memory_factory` / `set_settings_store` seam convention already used
by plugins/skills.py and plugins/builder.py. `context_fn` is a zero-arg
callable, called FRESH on every `delegate()` invocation (never cached) so
the tool set reflects the orchestrator's current registry -- e.g. a plugin
`builder_create` registered after Cerebral started. Until main.py wires it,
`delegate` fails closed with a clear error (mirrors plugins/builder.py's
`_ParkedBuilderPlugin`).
