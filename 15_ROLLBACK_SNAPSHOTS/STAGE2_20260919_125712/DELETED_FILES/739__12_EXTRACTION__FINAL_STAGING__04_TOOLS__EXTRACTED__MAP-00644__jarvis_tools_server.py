"""Jarvis' own tools, offered outwards as an MCP server.

Every other MCP module in this package points INWARDS: Jarvis is the client
that mounts somebody else's server (``client.py``, ``loader.py``,
``registry.py``), or projects a connected plugin into a worker's config
(``claude_export.py``, ``marketplace/mcp_bridge.py``). This module is the one
that points OUT — it lets an agent session that Jarvis spawned reach back in
and drive Jarvis itself.

That is what turns the typed chat from "a coding CLI that happens to run in
Jarvis' window" into Jarvis with a keyboard instead of a microphone: the model
paying with the person's subscription runs its own agent loop, but its hands
are the hands the voice has — ``open-app``, ``google-calendar``,
``wiki-recall``, ``switch-provider``, every registered tool plugin.

**The safety seam is structural, not polite.** Tools are listed from
:class:`~jarvis.core.protocols.SupervisorToolGateway` and executed through it,
which is the only authorized execution path in the codebase (AP-3). A caller
here cannot reach a tool's ``execute`` directly, so risk tiers, the approval
workflow and the audit log apply exactly as they do on the voice path — there
is no second door to keep in sync.

Transport is Streamable HTTP, mounted on the app's own web server
(``jarvis.ui.web.mcp_server_routes``) rather than a stdio child process. The
gateway lives in the running app's memory; a child process would only be able
to talk back over the same HTTP anyway, one hop later.
