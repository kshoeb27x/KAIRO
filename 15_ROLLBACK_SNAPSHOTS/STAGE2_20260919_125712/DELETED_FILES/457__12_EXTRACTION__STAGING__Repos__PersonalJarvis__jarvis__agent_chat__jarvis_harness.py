"""What makes a CLI seat's chat session Jarvis rather than a coding agent in a folder.

Three things are handed to the spawned CLI:

* an **MCP config** pointing at this app's own tool server
  (``jarvis.ui.web.mcp_server_routes``), so the model's hands are Jarvis' hands
  — the same catalog the voice path calls, through the same safety gateway.
  The config carries the chat's session id in a header, so the tool server can
  route an approval the executor asks for back to THIS chat's card;
* an **identity** — Jarvis' real system-prompt layers (soul, persona, the
  assistant file, the user's profile, the identity card, core memory, wiki
  context), the chat's own transcript on a fresh conversation, and the surface
  addendum below that says which hands are whose;
* a **system preamble** (the addendum) that tells it who it is and when to
  reach for those tools instead of a shell command.

Why this shape and not "Jarvis' brain drives the turn": the person pays for
these turns through a *subscription* (Claude Code, Codex, …), and a
subscription only pays for the CLI's own agent loop. Driving the loop from
Jarvis' brain would bill per token against an API key instead. So the CLI keeps
the wheel and Jarvis lends it the hands AND the head — the model works INSIDE
the Jarvis harness while the seat stays the person's own, and only the vendor's
official binary ever spends the subscription (maintainer, 2026-08-25).

This surface is deliberately additive: a CLI that cannot mount MCP servers, an
app whose tool gateway is not up yet, or a brain that has not finished building
simply runs with less. Nothing here is allowed to make a turn fail.

Currently unreachable, on purpose. No surface seats a CLI as Jarvis since the
front page's chat went API-only (2026-08-26, ``SurfaceKit.cli_seats``), so
``run_cli_turn(identity=…)`` is False on every turn today. The service asks the
kit — ``brain_runner and cli_seats`` — rather than a surface name, so a surface
that wants both picks this up without a change here. Keep it working.
