//! **MIRA-Guardian liveness sentinel** — the out-of-process watchdog
//! (`mira guardian-watch`).
//!
//! The co-resident Guardian watch loop runs *inside* the MIRA process, so the
//! one failure it cannot catch is MIRA itself going down — it shares MIRA's
//! fate. This sentinel is a **separate, supervised process** whose only job is
//! to confirm MIRA is alive and, if it isn't, raise a **direct** alarm to the
//! household — without routing through the (down) MIRA.
//!
//! It probes MIRA's unauthenticated `/livez` liveness endpoint on an interval.
//! `/livez` is dependency-free (no provider round-trip), so a busy or wedged
//! provider can't make a healthy MIRA look down — the sentinel only ever wanted
//! liveness, not readiness. **Any** HTTP response — even a 5xx — counts as alive;
//! only a transport error (connection refused / timeout) counts as down. After
//! `down_after_failures` consecutive misses it declares MIRA down and delivers a
//! web-push alarm, opened **cold** from the shared data dir (`web_push_vapid.key`
//! + `web_push.db`) so it works with MIRA fully offline. On recovery it clears
//! the alarm. Observe-and-alarm only in this increment — it never restarts or
//! mutates anything.
//!
//! The failure threshold is what makes a normal restart *not* alarm: MIRA comes
//! back within one probe window, so the miss count never reaches the threshold.
