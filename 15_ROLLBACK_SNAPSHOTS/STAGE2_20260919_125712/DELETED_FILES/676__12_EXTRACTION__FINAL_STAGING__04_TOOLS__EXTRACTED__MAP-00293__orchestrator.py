        without invoking the tool (Issue #52).

        ``call_tool`` takes exactly one capability per invocation and
        DISPATCHES the tool when the resolved decision is SILENT. That
        makes a per-capability loop unsafe — a SILENT cap would execute
        the tool side-effectfully before the next cap was checked,
        defeating the AND semantics the queue admission overlay relies
        on.

        This method resolves each capability through the ACL/gate pipeline
        (including the post-ACL ``passive`` escalation), takes the worst
        Decision across the set (DENY > ASK > SILENT), and *then* routes
        through the modal (for ``irreversible``) or consent surface (for
        ASK) — at most once per call. The caller (``approve_item``) uses
        the returned Decision to decide whether to dispatch and, if so,
        invokes ``call_tool`` exactly once.

        Returns:
            ``Decision.SILENT`` when every capability resolves silently
            (after any modal/consent acceptance) — the caller may dispatch.
            ``Decision.DENY`` otherwise — the caller must not dispatch.
            ``Decision.ASK`` is never returned from this method: ASK is
            either upgraded to SILENT/DENY by the consent surface, or
            (when no surface is wired) fails closed to DENY.
