# Jarvis Agent Coordination Board

Shared task board between **Claude (Cowork)** and **Codex**. Both agents read this at startup.

- `[CLAUDE]` — Cowork handles this (architecture, config, orchestration, UI, dashboards)
- `[CODEX]` — Codex handles this (code fixes, test loops, refactoring, targeted patches)
- `[BOTH]` — coordinate, one agent proposes, other reviews
- `[DONE]` — completed, timestamp noted
- `[BLOCKED]` — waiting on user input or external dependency

Update this file when picking up or finishing a task. Commit the update so the other agent sees it on next pull.

## Active Tasks

### [DONE] Silent-failure sweep — 87 bare except:pass sites across production code
**Completed by Antigravity 2026-06-25**
- Systematically replaced every `except: pass` and `except Exception: pass` in production modules with `logging.debug("...", exc_info=True)` so failures are visible in debug logs.
- **First batch** (loop-engineer session — `24e3cdb`, `6f0745b`, `ac7bdf3`, `71880a4`): `voice.py`, `jarvis_watcher.py`, `main.py`, `ui.py`, `_bg_agents.py`, `runtime_state.py`, `local_kokoro_subprocess_tts.py`, `hardware.py`, `jarvis_cli.py`, `mem0_layer.py`, `self_improve.py`, `model_router.py`
- **Second batch** (Antigravity — `9da8797`): `brain_daemon.py`, `desktop/hotkeys.py`, `evals.py`, `learner.py`, `local_runtime/agent_model_eval.py`, `project_manager.py`, `skill_monitor.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `vault_edit.py`, `voice.py` (2 remaining sites)
- **Intentionally skipped** (Claude-owned — do not sweep): `api.py` (1 remaining site at L7666), `router.py` (1 remaining site at L4470). Owner: Claude UX lane.
- All fixes: `py_compile` clean; 132 focused tests pass.
- **No remaining bare except:pass in non-Claude-owned production files.**

### [DONE] Mobile web fallback cooldown takeover
**Completed by Codex 2026-05-28**
- Took over the in-progress mobile web routing patch after Claude/Antigravity work.
- `api.py`: mobile web streams try Claude Haiku first, cache hard Claude failures for 10 minutes, and fall back to `GPT_MINI` without touching global mode.
- `tests/test_jarvis_regression_suite.py`: added API surface coverage for Claude failure fallback, cooldown skip, and retry after cooldown.

### [DONE] GRPO training support + package upgrades + Whisper upgrade + Apple Foundation fix
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-11**
- `local_runtime/local_mlx_dpo.py`: GRPO fully implemented in `run_preference_training()`.
  `list_algorithms()` now returns `["dpo", "orpo", "ipo", "grpo"]`.
  Added `_build_grpo_prompt_file()` helper — extracts user messages from latest overnight SFT pack as
  GRPO prompt data (GRPO uses prompts only, no preference pairs).
  Full `--train-mode grpo` command with `--group-size`, `--reward-functions`, `--reward-weights`,
  `--max-completion-length`, `--temperature`. Verified: `ok: True` on Apple Silicon with venv python.
- `local_runtime/local_finetune_scheduler.py`: `_collect_verbatim_examples(limit=80)` → `limit=100`.
  `_build_synthetic_examples()`: 21 → 34 patterns (meeting summaries, conversation control, code debugging).
- Training pack: 74 → 132 examples after dedup. 100 iters nightly (~30 min vs 37 sec).
- `.env`: `JARVIS_FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL=small.en` → `large-v3-turbo` (8x faster, same accuracy, ~1.6 GB).
- Packages installed: `fastembed` (hybrid BM25+semantic search in mem0), `mem0ai==2.0.2` (p95 17s→1.4s).
- `config.py`: Added `LOCAL_DEFAULT_DRAFTER = os.getenv("LOCAL_DEFAULT_DRAFTER", "")` (empty = disabled).
  Gemma 4 MTP drafter tag `gemma4:e4b-mtp` not yet in Ollama registry — commented out in `.env`.
- **Apple Foundation Model fix**: Wrong PyPI `apfel` package (functional programming lib, not the server).
  Real apfel is a native macOS binary: `brew tap Arthur-Ficial/tap && brew install apfel`.
  Corrected port: 11434 → **11438** in `.env` (`JARVIS_APPLE_FOUNDATION_BASE_URL`).
  `brain_apple_foundation.py` is fully coded and ready — just needs `apfel serve` running.

### [BLOCKED] Apple Foundation Model — needs brew install on user's Mac
**Owner: User**
- Run: `pip uninstall apfel -y` (removes wrong PyPI package)
- Run: `brew tap Arthur-Ficial/tap && brew install apfel`
- To use: `apfel serve &` (starts OpenAI-compatible server on port 11438)
- Then Jarvis `brain_apple_foundation.py` auto-detects and routes short queries there

### [DONE] Fix failing code test + training iterations + verbatim filter
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-07**
- `test_unit_coverage.py::ConversationContextTests::test_compact_if_needed_compacts_overflow`:
  Fixed off-by-one — 6 turns == limit exactly, never overflows. Changed to MAX_ACTIVE_TURNS+1.
  Code category now 320/320, overall should reach 608/608 (100%).
- `local_finetune_scheduler.py run_training()`: removed `num_iters=2` override.
  Now uses `config.MLX_NUM_ITERS` (default 100). ~30 min runtime vs 37 seconds before.
- `_collect_verbatim_examples()`: added knowledge-feed prefix filter ("Current date:"),
  per-query dedup cap (max 2× same user turn), limit raised 80→100.
  Result: 100 high-quality diverse verbatim examples vs 80 with duplicates.

### [DONE] Training pack expansion — 13 curated teacher examples + 13 more synthetic
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-08**
- 13 new teacher examples in `training/teacher_examples/jarvis_teacher_20260509_*.jsonl`:
  Coding/arch patterns: postgres zero-downtime migration, job queue design (SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED),
  optimistic vs pessimistic locking, flaky worker pool debugging.
  Verbatim interaction patterns: good morning/night, weather, calendar, battery, briefing, vault notes,
  marathon math. All 13 pass quality gate.
- Teacher pack: 11 → 24 examples.
- `_build_synthetic_examples()`: added 13 new patterns (meeting summaries, conversation control,
  code debugging). Synthetic: 21 → 34 examples.
- Call site limit fixed: `_collect_verbatim_examples(limit=80)` → `limit=100`.
- **Total pack tonight: 132 examples (was 74). Training: 100 iters (was 2).**
- NOTE: New teacher files are gitignored (runtime pattern). Need `git add -f` to commit,
  or user runs: `cd ~/jarvis-ai && git add -f training/teacher_examples/jarvis_teacher_20260509*.jsonl`

### [CODEX] Voice / PaMacCore AUHAL mic fix
**File:** `voice.py`, `local_runtime/local_stt.py`
**Goal:** Fix PaMacCore AUHAL errors causing mic input to fail
**Log:** `~/Library/Application Support/Jarvis/.jarvis_voice.log`
**Acceptance:** `test_voice_tts_regression.py` passes, mic opens without AUHAL error in log
**Status:** In progress

### [CODEX] mem0 / Qdrant end-to-end verification
**File:** `local_runtime/local_mem0.py`, `tests/test_mem0_layer.py`
**Goal:** Verify Qdrant vector store is reachable and mem0 reads/writes correctly
**Acceptance:** `test_mem0_layer.py` all pass with live Qdrant
**Status:** Open

### [DONE] Resolve qwen3 Ollama model tag
**Completed by Claude & Systems Architect 2026-05-29**
- Confirmed `qwen3.6:35b` is the installed MoE model on user's machine.
- Integrated `qwen3.6:35b` into `brains/brain_ollama.py` context limits (262,144 tokens) and first in fallback escalation order.
- Prioritized `LOCAL_QWEN3_6` (`qwen3.6:35b`) inside `model_router.py` general query selection to leverage this MoE model.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_qwen3_routing.py` confirming escalation, routing, and context limits. All 19 routing and OCR tests pass.

### [DONE] Benchmark run — all 7 categories
**Completed by Codex 2026-05-04 / verified Claude 2026-05-05**
All 7 categories non-skipped in benchmarks.jsonl: voice 34/34, calendar 43/43,
code 319/320, memory 23/23, tools 60/60, conversation 78/79, meeting 40/42.
Overall: 99.33% (597/601). Tonight's auto-run will update with richer training pack.

### [CLAUDE] iMessage Full Disk Access
**Goal:** Grant Full Disk Access to Terminal in System Settings so iMessage tools work
**Action:** User must do this manually: System Settings → Privacy → Full Disk Access → Terminal ✓
**Status:** Blocked (needs user)

### [DONE] Training pack quality — richer examples
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-05**
`build_training_pack()` now has 4 ranked sources:
1. Teacher examples from `training/teacher_examples/*.jsonl` (11 curated)
2. Real verbatim conversations from `memory/conversations/verbatim.jsonl` (up to 80 real pairs)
3. 21 handcrafted synthetic examples (calendar, terminal, voice, iMessage, memory, system control)
4. Legacy memory.json summaries as low-quality fallback (only if total < 30)
Pack size: 74 examples (up from 30 generic summaries). All in messages format for mlx_lm ≥0.31.x.
**Helpers added:** `_collect_teacher_examples()`, `_collect_verbatim_examples()`,
`_build_synthetic_examples()`, `_collect_legacy_summary_examples()`

## Parallel Automation Targets

### [DONE] Auto-commit training artifacts
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-05**
`_auto_commit_artifacts()` added to `local_finetune_scheduler.py` — Stage 6.
Commits overnight_log.jsonl, benchmarks.jsonl, dashboard.html, overnight_state.json
after each training run. Commit message format: `chore(training): overnight artifacts YYYY-MM-DD [promoted|no-promote]`

### [DONE] Notification when training completes
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-05**
`_notify_training_complete()` added to `local_finetune_scheduler.py` — Stage 7.
Sends macOS notification via `osascript` with promoted status and "Glass" sound.

### [CODEX] Auto-pull before each Codex session
Add to Codex startup: `git pull origin main` before reading repo state.
Ensures Codex always has Claude's latest changes.

## Handoff Notes

### [DONE] Training dashboard HUD redesign
**Completed by Claude 2026-05-06**
`training/dashboard_generator.py` HTML template fully rewritten to match J.A.R.V.I.S. HUD aesthetic:
- Dark space background (#050507) + hex-grid SVG overlay + CSS scanlines
- Animated blue orb with 3 concentric spinning rings (rspin/opulse keyframes)
- CSS custom properties for full palette (--cyan #00CFFF, --gold #FFB300, --green #00FF88)
- Corner bracket decorations on all cards via ::before/::after pseudo-elements
- Status chips row: ONLINE / BENCHMARK {score} / MLX TRAINING ACTIVE
- Section titles with `//` prefix glyph and cyan text-shadow glow
- Chart.js dark theme with matching gridlines and tooltip style
- All data sources preserved (routing stats, pack composition, category trends)

---

**Last Claude session (2026-05-11):**
- GRPO fully implemented in `local_runtime/local_mlx_dpo.py` — `run_preference_training(algorithm="grpo")` works
- Training pack: 74 → 132 examples; verbatim cap 80→100; synthetic 21→34 patterns
- `.env`: Whisper `small.en` → `large-v3-turbo`; Apple Foundation port corrected 11434 → 11438
- `config.py`: `LOCAL_DEFAULT_DRAFTER` added (empty by default; enable when Ollama releases gemma4 MTP tag)
- Installed: `fastembed` (hybrid BM25+semantic in mem0), `mem0ai==2.0.2`
- Apple Foundation Model: wrong `apfel` PyPI package identified and documented.
  User must: `pip uninstall apfel -y && brew tap Arthur-Ficial/tap && brew install apfel`
  Then `apfel serve &` to activate; `brain_apple_foundation.py` will auto-detect on port 11438.

**Last Antigravity session (2026-06-25):**
- Silent-failure sweep complete across all unclaimed production modules (commit `9da8797`).
- 87 total `except: pass` sites converted to `logging.debug(..., exc_info=True)`.
- **Two remaining sites left for Claude**: `api.py:7666`, `router.py:4470` — in Claude's owned files, intentionally not touched.
- Verification: `py_compile` clean on all 39 modified files; 132 focused tests pass.
- Safe to pull and continue work — no files in Claude or Codex active lanes were edited.

**For Codex next session:** Pull latest. Voice AUHAL fix + mem0 Qdrant verification +
qwen3 model tag still open. See `.claude/skills/jarvis-voice.md` for voice checklist.
Wire `LOCAL_DEFAULT_DRAFTER` into `brain_ollama.py` when Ollama releases gemma4 MTP tag.

**For Claude next session:** Two silent-failure sites remain in your files (`api.py:7666`, `router.py:4470`). Sweep those when you next touch those files. Silent-failure sweep otherwise DONE for the whole codebase.
